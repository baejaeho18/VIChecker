      "\t\t\"body\": \"* Change default handoffConditionTimeout to 15 minutes.  Most of the time, when handoff is taking this long, it's because something is preventing Historicals from loading new data. In this case, we have two choices:  1) Stop making progress on ingestion, wait for Historicals to load stuff,    and keep the waiting-for-handoff segments available on realtime tasks.    (handoffConditionTimeout = 0, the current default)  2) Continue making progress on ingestion, by exiting the realtime tasks    that were waiting for handoff. Once the Historicals get their act    together, the segments will be loaded, as they are still there on    deep storage. They will just not be continuously available.    (handoffConditionTimeout > 0)  I believe most users would prefer [2], because [1] risks ingestion falling behind the stream, which causes many other problems. It can cause data loss if the stream ages-out data before we have a chance to ingest it.  Due to the way tuningConfigs are serialized -- defaults are baked into the serialized form that is written to the database -- this default change will not change anyone's existing supervisors. It will take effect for newly created supervisors.  * Fix tests.  * Update docs/development/extensions-core/kafka-supervisor-reference.md  Co-authored-by: Katya Macedo  <38017980+ektravel@users.noreply.github.com>  * Update docs/development/extensions-core/kinesis-ingestion.md  Co-authored-by: Katya Macedo  <38017980+ektravel@users.noreply.github.com>  ---------  Co-authored-by: Katya Macedo <38017980+ektravel@users.noreply.github.com>\",\n",

Main changes: - Run task completion callbacks in a separate executor to handle task completion updates - Add new config `druid.indexer.queue.taskCompleteHandlerNumThreads` - Add metrics to monitor number of processed and queued items - There are still other paths that can invoke `notifyStatus`, but those need not be moved to the new executor as they are synchronous on purpose.  Other changes: - Add new metrics `task/status/queue/count`, `task/status/handled/count` - Add `TaskCountStatsProvider.getStats()` which deprecates the other `getXXXTaskCount` methods. - Use `CoordinatorRunStats` to collect and report metrics. This class has been used as is for now but will later be renamed and repurposed to use across all Druid services. \",\n",

This must be an option rather than always-on, because prior to this patch, HLL sketches used UTF-16LE encoding when hashing strings. To remain compatible with sketch images created prior to this patch -- which matters during rolling updates and when reading sketches that have been written to segments -- we must keep UTF-16LE as the default.  Not currently documented, because I'm not yet sure how best to expose this functionality to users. I think the first place would be in the SQL layer: we could have it automatically select UTF-8 or UTF-16LE when building sketches at query time. We need to be careful about this, though, because UTF-8 isn't always faster. Sometimes, like for the results of expressions, UTF-16LE is faster. I expect we will sort this out in future patches.  * Fix benchmark.  * Fix style issues, improve test coverage.  * Put round back, to make IT updates easier.  * Fix test.  * Fix issue with filtered aggregators and add test.  * Use DS native update(ByteBuffer) method.

Testing strategy:  1) Add a mmappedWithSqlCompatibleNulls case to BaseFilterTest that    writes segments under SQL-compatible mode, and reads them under    default-value mode.  2) Unit tests for the new wrapper classes (CombineFirstTwoEntriesIndexed,    CombineFirstTwoValuesColumnarInts, CombineFirstTwoValuesColumnarMultiInts,    CombineFirstTwoValuesIndexedInts).  * Fix a mistake, use more singlethreadedness.  * WIP  * Tests, improvements.  * Style.  * See Spot bug.  * Remove unused method.  * Address review comments.  1) Read bitmaps even if we don't retain them. 2) Combine StringFrontCodedDictionaryEncodedColumn and ScalarStringDictionaryEncodedColumn.  * Add missing tests.\",\n",

This improves accuracy for jobs with many time chunks, and reduces memory usage.  The main downside of SEQUENTIAL is that it can take longer, but in most situations I've seen, PARALLEL is only really usable in cases where the sketches are small enough that SEQUENTIAL would also run relatively quickly. So it seems like SEQUENTIAL is a better default.  * Switch off-test from SEQUENTIAL to PARALLEL.  * Fix sequential merge for situations where there are no time chunks at all.  * Add a couple more tests.\",\n",

Four main changes:  1) Provide aggregatorBuilder, a more consistent way of defining the    SqlAggFunction we need for all of our SQL aggregators. The mechanism    is analogous to the one we already use for SQL functions    (OperatorConversions.operatorBuilder).  2) Allow CASTs of constants to be considered as \\\"literalOperands\\\". This    fixes an issue where various of our operators are defined with    OperandTypes.LITERAL as part of their checkers, which doesn't allow    casts. However, in these cases we generally _do_ want to allow casts.    The important piece is that the value must be reducible to a constant,    not that the SQL text is literally a literal.  3) Update DataSketches SQL aggregators to use the new aggregatorBuilder    functionality. The main user-visible effect here is [2]: the aggregators    would now accept, for example, \\\"CAST(0.99 AS DOUBLE)\\\" as a literal    argument. Other aggregators could be updated in a future patch.  4) Rename \\\"requiredOperands\\\" to \\\"requiredOperandCount\\\", because the    old name was confusing. (It rhymes with \\\"literalOperands\\\" but the    arguments mean different things.)  * Adjust method calls.\",\n",

Changed classes: - Add `StrategicSegmentAssigner` to make assignment decisions for load, replicate and move - Add `SegmentAction` to distinguish between load, replicate, drop and move operations - Add `SegmentReplicationStatus` to capture current state of replication of all used segments - Add `SegmentLoadingConfig` to contain recomputed dynamic config values - Simplify classes `LoadRule`, `BroadcastRule` - Simplify the `BalancerStrategy` and `CostBalancerStrategy` - Add several new methods to `ServerHolder` to track loaded and queued segments - Refactor `DruidCoordinator`  Impact: - Enable `smartSegmentLoading` by default. With this enabled, none of the following dynamic configs need to be set: `maxSegmentsToMove`, `replicationThrottleLimit`, `maxSegmentsInNodeLoadingQueue`, `useRoundRobinSegmentAssignment`, `emitBalancingStats` and `replicantLifetime`. - Coordinator reports richer metrics and produces cleaner and more informative logs - Coordinator uses an unlimited load queue for all serves, and makes better assignment decisions\",\n",

Changes: - Track replication factor in `SegmentReplicantLookup` during evaluation of load rules - Update API `/druid/coordinator/v1metadata/segments` to return replication factor - Add column `replication_factor` to the sys.segments virtual table and populate it in `MetadataSegmentView` - If this column is 0, the segment is not assigned to any historical and will not be loaded.\",\n",

This query parameter allows users to control the maximum number of bytes, with granularity of input file / object, that ingestion tasks will be assigned to ingest. With this change, this context parameter now denotes the estimated weighted size in bytes of the input to split on, with consideration for input format and compression format, rather than the actual file size, reported by the file system.  We assume uncompressed newline delimited json as a baseline, with scaling factor of `1`. This means that when computing the byte weight that a file has towards the input splitting, we take the file size as is, if uncompressed json, 1:1. It was found during testing that gzip compressed json, and parquet, has scale factors of `4` and `8` respectively, meaning that each byte of data is weighted 4x and 8x respectively, when computing input splits. This weighted byte scaling is only considered for MSQ ingestion that uses either LocalInputSource or CloudObjectInputSource at the moment. The default value of the `maxInputBytesPerWorker` query context parameter has been updated from 10 GiB, to 512 MiB\",\n",

A very large value can cause excessive moves, which has these disadvantages: - Load of moving segments competing with load of unavailable/under-replicated segments - Unnecessary network costs due to constant download and delete of segments  These defaults will be revisited after #13197 is merged.\",\n",

This is a behavior change around when segment driven schema migrations take effect for the SQL schema. With latestInterval, the SQL schema will be updated as soon as the first job with the new schema has published segments, while using leastRestrictive, the schema will only be updated once all segments are reindexed to the new type. The benefit of leastRestrictive is that it eliminates a bunch of type coercion errors that can happen in SQL when types are varied across segments with latestInterval because the newest type is not able to correctly represent older data, such as if the segments have a mix of ARRAY and number types, or any other combinations that lead to odd query plans.\",\n",

These columns use a delta based bit-packing mechanism, and errors in the vectorized reader would cause it to incorrectly read column values for some bit sizes (1 through 32 bits). This is a regression caused by #11004, which added the optimized readers to improve performance, so impacts Druid versions 0.22.0+.  While writing the test I finally got sad enough about IndexSpec not having a \\\"builder\\\", so I made one, and switched all the things to use it. Apologies for the noise in this bug fix PR, the only real changes are in VSizeLongSerde, and the tests that have been modified to cover the buggy behavior, VSizeLongSerdeTest and ExpressionVectorSelectorsTest. Everything else is just cleanup of IndexSpec usage.\",\n",

Prior to this change, the two stages could    delete each others' segments.  3) ReferenceCountingResourceHolder: increment() returns a new ResourceHolder,    rather than a Releaser. This allows it to be passed to callers without them    having to hold on to both the original ResourceHolder *and* a Releaser.  4) Simplify various interfaces and implementations by using ResourceHolder    instead of Pair and instead of split-up fields.  * Add test.  * Fix style.  * Remove Releaser.  * Updates from master.  * Add some GuardedBys.  * Use the correct GuardedBy.  * Adjustments.\",\n",

The main change is the new tests: we now subclass CalciteJoinQueryTest in CalciteSelectJoinQueryMSQTest twice, once for Broadcast and once for SortMerge.  Two supporting production changes for default-value mode:  1) InputNumberDataSource is marked as concrete, to allow leftFilter to    be pushed down to it.  2) In default-value mode, numeric frame field readers can now return nulls.    This is necessary when stacking joins on top of joins: nulls must be    preserved for semantics that match broadcast joins and native queries.  3) In default-value mode, StringFieldReader.isNull returns true on empty    strings in addition to nulls. This is more consistent with the behavior    of the selectors, which map empty strings to null as well in that mode.  As an effect of change (2), the InsertTimeNull change from #14020 (to replace null timestamps with default timestamps) is reverted. IMO, this is fine, as either behavior is defensible, and the change from #14020 hasn't been released yet.  * Adjust tests.  * Style fix.  * Additional tests.\",\n",

Subqueries do not need to be groupBy anymore; they can really be any type of query. If I recall correctly, the change was needed for certain window queries to be able to plan on top of Scan queries.  However, this impacts performance negatively, because it causes many additional outer-query scenarios to be considered, which is expensive.  So, this patch updates the matching logic to consider fewer scenarios. The skipped scenarios are ones where we expect that, for one reason or another, it isn't necessary to consider a subquery.  * Remove unnecessary escaping.  * Fix test.\",\n",

Fixed a bug where when the input source type security feature is enabled, all of the input source type specific resources used where authenticated against:  `{\\\"resource\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"EXTERNAL\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"{INPUT_SOURCE_TYPE}\\\"}, \\\"action\\\": \\\"READ\\\"}`  When they should be instead authenticated against:  `{\\\"resource\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"{INPUT_SOURCE_TYPE}\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"EXTERNAL\\\"}, \\\"action\\\": \\\"READ\\\"}`  3. fixed bug where supervisor tasks were not authenticated against the specific input source types used, if input source security feature was enabled.\",\n",

This allows MSQ to create JoinDataSource with InputNumberDataSource    as the base.  2) Add SegmentWranglerModule to CliIndexer, CliPeon.

This change reverts those changes inside of the tasks and makes it so that only the task runners are the ones that make decisions about which mount points should be used for storing task-related files.

To enable this feature, the user must set the following property to true:  `druid.auth.enableInputSourceSecurity=true`  The default value for this property is false, which will continue the existing functionality of needing authorization to write to the respective datasource.  When this config is enabled, the users will be required to be authorized for the following resource action, in addition to write permission on the respective datasource.  `new ResourceAction(new Resource(ResourceType.EXTERNAL, {INPUT_SOURCE_TYPE}, Action.READ`  where `{INPUT_SOURCE_TYPE}` is the type of the input source being used;, http, inline, s3, etc..  Only tasks that provide a non-default implementation of the `getInputSourceResources` method can be submitted when config `druid.auth.enableInputSourceSecurity=true` is set. Otherwise, a 400 error will be thrown.\",\n",

      "\t\t\"body\": \"* Always use file sizes when determining batch ingest splits.  Main changes:  1) Update CloudObjectInputSource and its subclasses (S3, GCS,    Azure, Aliyun OSS) to use SplitHintSpecs in all cases. Previously, they    were only used for prefixes, not uris or objects.  2) Update ExternalInputSpecSlicer (MSQ) to consider file size. Previously,    file size was ignored; all files were treated as equal weight when    determining splits.  A side effect of these changes is that we'll make additional network calls to find the sizes of objects when users specify URIs or objects as opposed to prefixes. IMO, this is worth it because it's the only way to respect the user's split hint and task assignment settings.  Secondary changes:  1) S3, Aliyun OSS: Use getObjectMetadata instead of listObjects to get    metadata for a single object. This is a simpler call that is also    expected to be less expensive.  2) Azure: Fix a bug where getBlobLength did not populate blob    reference attributes, and therefore would not actually retrieve the    blob length.  3) MSQ: Align dynamic slicing logic between ExternalInputSpecSlicer and    TableInputSpecSlicer.  4) MSQ: Adjust WorkerInputs to ensure there is always at least one    worker, even if it has a nil slice.  * Add msqCompatible to testGroupByWithImpossibleTimeFilter.  * Fix tests.  * Add additional tests.  * Remove unused stuff.  * Remove more unused stuff.  * Adjust thresholds.  * Remove irrelevant test.  * Fix comments.  * Fix bug.  * Updates.\",\n",

This means that the thread is stuck waiting on a fabric8 event (the job being successful) that will never come up until maxTaskDuration (default 4 hours). If a user of the extension is trying to use a limited taskqueue maxSize, this can cause problems as the k8s executor pool is unable to pick up additional tasks (since threads are stuck waiting on the old tasks that have already been deleted).\",\n",

To enable this feature, the user must set the following property to true:  druid.auth.enableInputSourceSecurity=true  The default value for this property is false, which will continue the existing functionality of having the usage all external sources being authorized against the hardcoded resource action  new ResourceAction(new Resource(ResourceType.EXTERNAL, ResourceType.EXTERNAL), Action.READ  When this config is enabled, the users will be required to be authorized for the following resource action  new ResourceAction(new Resource(ResourceType.EXTERNAL, {INPUT_SOURCE_TYPE}, Action.READ  where {INPUT_SOURCE_TYPE} is the type of the input source being used;, http, inline, s3, etc..  Documentation has not been added for the feature as it is not complete at the moment, as we still need to enable this for the native layer in a follow up pr.\",\n",

The thinking here is that for best ingestion throughput, we want intermediate persists to be as big as possible without using up all available memory. So, we rely mainly on maxBytesInMemory. The default maxRowsInMemory (1 million) is really just a safety: in case we have a large number of very small rows, we don't want to get overwhelmed by per-row overheads.  However, maximum ingestion throughput isn't necessarily the primary goal for realtime ingestion. Query performance is also important. And because query performance is not as good on the in-memory dataset, it's helpful to keep it from growing too large. 150k seems like a reasonable balance here. It means that for a typical 5 million row segment, we won't trigger more than 33 persists due to this limit, which is a reasonable number of persists.  * Update tests.  * Update server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/segment/indexing/RealtimeTuningConfig.java  Co-authored-by: Kashif Faraz <kashif.faraz@gmail.com>  * Fix test.  * Fix link.  ---------  Co-authored-by: Kashif Faraz <kashif.faraz@gmail.com>\",\n",

      "\t\t\"body\": \"* Various changes and fixes to UNNEST.  Native changes:  1) UnnestDataSource: Replace \\\"column\\\" and \\\"outputName\\\" with \\\"virtualColumn\\\".    This enables pushing expressions into the datasource. This in turn    allows us to do the next thing...  2) UnnestStorageAdapter: Logically apply query-level filters and virtual    columns after the unnest operation. (Physically, filters are pulled up,    when possible.) This is beneficial because it allows filters and    virtual columns to reference the unnested column, and because it is    consistent with how the join datasource works.  3) Various documentation updates, including declaring \\\"unnest\\\" as an    experimental feature for now.  SQL changes:  1) Rename DruidUnnestRel (& Rule) to DruidUnnestRel (& Rule). The rel    is simplified: it only handles the UNNEST part of a correlated join.    Constant UNNESTs are handled with regular inline rels.  2) Rework DruidCorrelateUnnestRule to focus on pulling Projects from    the left side up above the Correlate. New test testUnnestTwice verifies    that this works even when two UNNESTs are stacked on the same table.  3) Include ProjectCorrelateTransposeRule from Calcite to encourage    pushing mappings down below the left-hand side of the Correlate.  4) Add a new CorrelateFilterLTransposeRule and CorrelateFilterRTransposeRule    to handle pulling Filters up above the Correlate. New tests    testUnnestWithFiltersOutside and testUnnestTwiceWithFilters verify    this behavior.  5) Require a context feature flag for SQL UNNEST, since it's undocumented.    As part of this, also cleaned up how we handle feature flags in SQL.    They're now hooked into EngineFeatures, which is useful because not    all engines support all features. \",\n",

      "\t\t\"body\": \"* Window planning: use collation traits, improve subquery logic.  SQL changes:  1) Attach RelCollation (sorting) trait to any PartialDruidQuery    that ends in AGGREGATE or AGGREGATE_PROJECT. This allows planning to    take advantage of the fact that Druid sorts by dimensions when    doing aggregations.  2) Windowing: inspect RelCollation trait from input, and insert naiveSort    if, and only if, necessary.  3) Windowing: add support for Project after Window, when the Project    is a simple mapping. Helps eliminate subqueries.  4) DruidRules: update logic for considering subqueries to reflect that    subqueries are not required to be GroupBys, and that we have a bunch    of new Stages now. With all of this evolution that has happened, the    old logic didn't quite make sense.  Native changes:  1) Use merge sort (stable) rather than quicksort when sorting    RowsAndColumns. Makes it easier to write test cases for plans that    involve re-sorting the data.  * Changes from review.  * Mark the bad test as failing.  * Additional update.  * Fix failingTest.  * Fix tests.  * Mark a var final.\",\n",

      "\t\t\"body\": \"* Sort-merge join and hash shuffles for MSQ.  The main changes are in the processing, multi-stage-query, and sql modules.  processing module:  1) Rename SortColumn to KeyColumn, replace boolean descending with KeyOrder.    This makes it nicer to model hash keys, which use KeyOrder.NONE.  2) Add nullability checkers to the FieldReader interface, and an    \\\"isPartiallyNullKey\\\" method to FrameComparisonWidget. The join    processor uses this to detect null keys.  3) Add WritableFrameChannel.isClosed and OutputChannel.isReadableChannelReady    so callers can tell which OutputChannels are ready for reading and which    aren't.  4) Specialize FrameProcessors.makeCursor to return FrameCursor, a random-access    implementation. The join processor uses this to rewind when it needs to    replay a set of rows with a particular key.  5) Add MemoryAllocatorFactory, which is embedded inside FrameWriterFactory    instead of a particular MemoryAllocator. This allows FrameWriterFactory    to be shared in more scenarios.  multi-stage-query module:  1) ShuffleSpec: Add hash-based shuffles. New enum ShuffleKind helps callers    figure out what kind of shuffle is happening. The change from SortColumn    to KeyColumn allows ClusterBy to be used for both hash-based and sort-based    shuffling.  2) WorkerImpl: Add ability to handle hash-based shuffles. Refactor the logic    to be more readable by moving the work-order-running code to the inner    class RunWorkOrder, and the shuffle-pipeline-building code to the inner    class ShufflePipelineBuilder.  3) Add SortMergeJoinFrameProcessor and factory.  4) WorkerMemoryParameters: Adjust logic to reserve space for output frames    for hash partitioning. (We need one frame per partition.)  sql module:  1) Add sqlJoinAlgorithm context parameter; can be \\\"broadcast\\\" or    \\\"sortMerge\\\". With native, it must always be \\\"broadcast\\\", or it's a    validation error. MSQ supports both. Default is \\\"broadcast\\\" in    both engines.  2) Validate that MSQs do not use broadcast join with RIGHT or FULL join,    as results are not correct for broadcast join with those types. Allow    this in native for two reasons: legacy (the docs caution against it,    but it's always been allowed), and the fact that it actually *does*    generate correct results in native when the join is processed on the    Broker. It is much less likely that MSQ will plan in such a way that    generates correct results.  3) Remove subquery penalty in DruidJoinQueryRel when using sort-merge    join, because subqueries are always required, so there's no reason    to penalize them.  4) Move previously-disabled join reordering and manipulation rules to    FANCY_JOIN_RULES, and enable them when using sort-merge join. Helps    get to better plans where projections and filters are pushed down.  * Work around compiler problem.  * Updates from static analysis.  * Fix @param tag.  * Fix declared exception.  * Fix spelling.  * Minor adjustments.  * wip  * Merge fixups  * fixes  * Fix CalciteSelectQueryMSQTest  * Empty keys are sortable.  * Address comments from code review. Rename mux -> mix.  * Restore inspection config.  * Restore original doc.  * Reorder imports.  * Adjustments  * Fix.  * Fix imports.  * Adjustments from review.  * Update header.  * Adjust docs.\",\n",

This works great when we have a single-column join key: we simply retrieve the list and we know what rows match. However, when we have a composite key, we need to merge the sorted lists. This is inefficient when one is very dense and others are very sparse.  This patch switches from sorted IntList to IntSortedSet, and changes to the following intersection algorithm:  1) Initialize the intersection set to the smallest matching set from the    various parts of the composite key.  2) For each element in that smallest set, check other sets for that element.    If any do *not* include it, then remove the element from the intersection    set.  This way, complexity scales with the size of the smallest set, not the largest one.  * RangeIntSet stuff.\",\n",

A user may want to do this for a number of reasons, including security concerns. The default value of this property is the empty list `[]`, which does not disallow any operator conversions.  An example usage of this property is `druid.sql.planner.operatorConversion.denyList=[\\\"extern\\\"]`, which disallows the usage of the `extern` operator conversion. If the property is configured this way, and a user of the Druid cluster tries to submit a query that uses the `extern` function, such as the example given [here](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/multi-stage-query/examples.html#insert-with-no-rollup), a response with http response code `400` is returned with en error body similar to the following:  ``` {   \\\"taskId\\\": \\\"4ec5b0b6-fa9b-4c3a-827d-2308294e9985\\\",   \\\"state\\\": \\\"FAILED\\\",   \\\"error\\\": {     \\\"error\\\": \\\"Plan validation failed\\\",     \\\"errorMessage\\\": \\\"org.apache.calcite.runtime.CalciteContextException: From line 28, column 5 to line 32, column 5: No match found for function signature EXTERN(<CHARACTER>, <CHARACTER>, <CHARACTER>)\\\",     \\\"errorClass\\\": \\\"org.apache.calcite.tools.ValidationException\\\",     \\\"host\\\": null   } } ```\",\n",

This algorithm does 2 things that was CPU  1) The Union object always builds an HLL_8 sketch regardless of the   target type.  This means that when the target type is not HLL_8, we   spent CPU cycles converting to HLL_8 and back over and over again 2) By throwing away the Union object and converting back to the   HllSketch only to build another Union object, we do lots and lots   of copy+conversions of the HllSketch  This change introduces an HllSketchHolder object which can hold onto a Union object and delay conversion back into an HllSketch until it is actually needed.  This follows the same pattern as the SketchHolder object for theta sketches. \",\n",

This became abundantly clear and painful during a change I was making for Window Functions, so I unified them into using the same code for walking the response and serializing it.  Things are still not perfectly unified (it would be the absolute best if the SqlResource just took SQL, planned it and then delegated the query run entirely to the QueryResource), but this refactor doesn't take that fully on.  The new code leverages async query processing from our jetty container, the different interaction model with the Resource means that a lot of tests had to be adjusted to align with the async query model.  The semantics of the tests remain the same with one exception: the SqlResource used to not log requests that failed authorization checks, now it does.\",\n",

      "\t\t\"body\": \"This PR expands `StringDimensionIndexer` to handle conversion of `byte[]` to base64 encoded strings, rather than the current behavior of calling java `toString`.   This issue was uncovered by a regression of sorts introduced by #13519, which updated the protobuf extension to directly convert stuff to java types, resulting in `bytes` typed values being converted as `byte[]` instead of a base64 string which the previous JSON based conversion created. While outputting `byte[]` is more consistent with other input formats, and preferable when the bytes can be consumed directly (such as complex types serde), when fed to a `StringDimensionIndexer`, it resulted in an ugly java `toString` because `processRowValsToUnsortedEncodedKeyComponent` is fed the output of `row.getRaw(..)`. Converting `byte[]` to a base64 string within `StringDimensionIndexer` is consistent with the behavior of calling `row.getDimension(..)` which does do this coercion (and why many tests on binary types appeared to be doing the expected thing).  I added some protobuf `bytes` tests, but they don't really hit the new `StringDimensionIndexer` behavior because they operate on the `InputRow` directly, and call `getDimension` to validate stuff. The parser based version still uses the old conversion mechanisms, so when not using a flattener incorrectly calls `toString` on the `ByteString`.

To use an example of a variant typed nested column with 3 values `[\\\"1\\\", null, -2]`. The string dictionary is `[null, \\\"1\\\"]`, the long dictionary is `[-2]` and our local dictionary is `[0, 1, 2]`.  The code for variant typed indexes checks if the value is present in all global dictionaries and returns indexes for all matches. So in this case, we first lookup \\\"1\\\" in the string dictionary, find it at global id 1, all is good. Now, we check the long dictionary for `1`, which due to  `-(insertionpoint + 1)` gives us `-(1 + 2) = -2`. Since the global id space is actually stacked dictionaries, global ids for long and double values must be \\\"adjusted\\\" by the size of string dictionary, and size of string + size of long for doubles.  Prior to this patch we were not checking that the globalId is 0 or larger, we then immediately looked up the `localDictionary.indexOf(-2 + adjustLong) = localDictionary.indexOf(-2 + 2) = localDictionary.indexOf(0)` ... which is an actual value contained in the dictionary! The fix is to skip the longs completely since there were no global matches.  On to doubles, `-(insertionPoint + 1)` gives us `-(0 + 1) = -1`. The double adjust value is '3' since 2 strings and 1 long, so `localDictionary.indexOf(-1 + 3)` = `localDictionary.indexOf(2)`  which is also a real value in our local dictionary that is definitely not '1'.  So in this one case, looking for '1' incorrectly ended up matching every row.\",\n",

This does not use the new `InputSourceReader.read(inputStats)` method. - Extend `InputStats` with `RowIngestionMeters` so that bytes can be exposed in task reports  Other changes: - Update tests to verify the value of `processedBytes` - Rename `MutableRowIngestionMeters` to `SimpleRowIngestionMeters` and remove duplicate class - Replace `CacheTestSegmentCacheManager` with `NoopSegmentCacheManager` - Refactor `KafkaIndexTaskTest` and `KinesisIndexTaskTest` \",\n",

This changes default behavior from writing an index.zip to writing    a regular directory.

QueryKit would interpret that as a request to configure bucketing for all native queries. This isn't useful, as bucketing is only used for the penultimate stage in INSERT / REPLACE.  So, this patch modifies QueryKit to only look at sqlInsertSegmentGranularity on the outermost query.  As an additional change, this patch switches the static ObjectMapper to use the processwide ObjectMapper for deserializing Granularities. Saves an ObjectMapper instance, and ensures that if there are any special serdes registered for Granularity, we'll pick them up.\",\n",

      "\t\t\"body\": \"In a cluster with a large number of streaming tasks (~1000), SegmentAllocateActions  on the overlord can often take very long intervals of time to finish thus causing spikes  in the `task/action/run/time`. This may result in lag building up while a task waits for a segment to get allocated.  The root causes are: - large number of metadata calls made to the segments and pending segments tables - `giant` lock held in `TaskLockbox.tryLock()` to acquire task locks and allocate segments  Since the contention typically arises when several tasks of the same datasource try to allocate segments for the same interval/granularity, the allocation run times can be improved by batching the requests together.  Changes - Add flags    - `druid.indexer.tasklock.batchSegmentAllocation` (default `false`)    - `druid.indexer.tasklock.batchAllocationMaxWaitTime` (in millis) (default `1000`) - Add methods `canPerformAsync` and `performAsync` to `TaskAction` - Submit each allocate action to a `SegmentAllocationQueue`, and add to correct batch - Process batch after `batchAllocationMaxWaitTime` - Acquire `giant` lock just once per batch in `TaskLockbox` - Reduce metadata calls by batching statements together and updating query filters - Except for batching, retain the whole behaviour (order of steps, retries, etc.) - Respond to leadership changes and fail items in queue when not leader - Emit batch and request level metrics \",\n",

Other, related changes: 1) Add ServiceRetryPolicy.retryNotAvailable, which controls whether    ServiceClient retries unavailable services. Useful since we do not    want to retry calls unavailable tasks within the service client. (The    supervisor does its own higher-level retries.) 2) Add FutureUtils.transformAsync, a more lambda friendly version of    Futures.transform(f, AsyncFunction). 3) Add FutureUtils.coalesce. Similar to Futures.successfulAsList, but    returns Either instead of using null on error. 4) Add JacksonUtils.readValue overloads for JavaType and TypeReference.\",\n",

The PR (Adds Idle feature to `SeekableStreamSupervisor` for inactive stream) - https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/13144 updates the resulting lag calculation map in `KafkaSupervisor` to include all the latest partitions from the stream to set the idle state accordingly rather than the previous way of lag calculation only for the partitions actively being read from the stream. This led to an explosion of metrics in lag reports in cases where 1000s of tasks per supervisor are present.  Changes: - Add a new method to generate lags for only those partitions a single task is actively reading from while updating the Supervisor reports.\",\n",

There are various places in Druid code where we assume that String.compareTo is consistent with Unicode code-point ordering. Sadly this is not the case.  To help deal with this, this patch introduces the following helpers:  1) compareUnicode: Compares two Strings in Unicode code-point order. 2) compareUtf8: Compares two UTF-8 byte arrays in Unicode code-point order.    Equivalent to comparison as unsigned bytes. 3) compareUtf8UsingJavaStringOrdering: Compares two UTF-8 byte arrays, or    ByteBuffers, in a manner consistent with String.compareTo.  There is no helper for comparing two Strings in a manner consistent with String.compareTo, because for that we can use compareTo directly.  The patch also fixes an inconsistency between the String and UTF-8 dictionary GenericIndexed flavors of string-typed columns: they were formerly using incompatible comparators.  * Adjust test.  * FrontCodedIndexed updates.  * Add test.  * Fix comments.\",\n",

Compact tasks include the ability to fetch existing segments and determine reasonable defaults for granularitySpec, dimensionsSpec, and metricsSpec. This is a useful feature that makes compact tasks work well even when the user running the compaction does not have a clear idea of what they want the compacted segments to be like.  However, this comes at a cost: it takes time, and disk space, to do all of these fetches. This patch improves the situation in two ways:  1) When segments do need to be fetched, download them one at a time and    delete them when we're done. This still takes time, but minimizes the    required disk space.  2) Don't fetch segments on the main compact task when they aren't needed.    If the user provides a full granularitySpec, dimensionsSpec, and    metricsSpec, we can skip it.  * Adjustments.  * Changes from code review.  * Fix logic for determining rollup.\",\n",

      "\t\t\"body\": \"* Always return sketches from DS_HLL, DS_THETA, DS_QUANTILES_SKETCH.  These aggregation functions are documented as creating sketches. However, they are planned into native aggregators that include finalization logic to convert the sketch to a number of some sort. This creates an inconsistency: the functions sometimes return sketches, and sometimes return numbers, depending on where they lie in the native query plan.  This patch changes these SQL aggregators to _never_ finalize, by using the \\\"shouldFinalize\\\" feature of the native aggregators. It already existed for theta sketches. This patch adds the feature for hll and quantiles sketches.  As to impact, Druid finalizes aggregators in two cases:  - When they appear in the outer level of a query (not a subquery). - When they are used as input to an expression or finalizing-field-access   post-aggregator (not any other kind of post-aggregator).  With this patch, the functions will no longer be finalized in these cases.  The second item is not likely to matter much. The SQL functions all declare return type OTHER, which would be usable as an input to any other function that makes sense and that would be planned into an expression.  So, the main effect of this patch is the first item. To provide backwards compatibility with anyone that was depending on the old behavior, the patch adds a \\\"sqlFinalizeOuterSketches\\\" query context parameter that restores the old behavior.  Other changes:  1) Move various argument-checking logic from runtime to planning time in    DoublesSketchListArgBaseOperatorConversion, by adding an OperandTypeChecker.  2) Add various JsonIgnores to the sketches to simplify their JSON representations.  3) Allow chaining of ExpressionPostAggregators and other PostAggregators    in the SQL layer.  4) Avoid unnecessary FieldAccessPostAggregator wrapping in the SQL layer,    now that expressions can operate on complex inputs.  5) Adjust return type to thetaSketch (instead of OTHER) in    ThetaSketchSetBaseOperatorConversion.  * Fix benchmark class.  * Fix compilation error.  * Fix ThetaSketchSqlAggregatorTest.  * Hopefully fix ITAutoCompactionTest.  * Adjustment to ITAutoCompactionTest.\",\n",

This patch modifies the SQL planner to avoid generating queries that would throw such errors, by switching certain plans to use the timestamp_floor function instead of granularities. This applies both to the Timeseries query type, and the GroupBy timestampResultFieldGranularity feature.  The patch also goes one step further: we switch to timestamp_floor not just in the ETERNITY + non-ALL case, but also if the estimated number of time-granular buckets exceeds 100,000.  Finally, the patch modifies the timestampResultFieldGranularity field to consistently be a String rather than a Granularity. This ensures that it can be round-trip serialized and deserialized, which is useful when trying to execute the results of \\\"EXPLAIN PLAN FOR\\\" with GroupBy queries that use the timestampResultFieldGranularity feature.  * Fix test, address PR comments.  * Fix ControllerImpl.  * Fix test.  * Fix unused import.\",\n",

We were not accounting for the memory overhead of the String object, which I've found in testing to be ~40 bytes. While this overhead may be java version dependent, it should not vary much, and accounting for this provides a better estimate. Also fixed some logging, and reading bytes from the JDBI result set a little more efficient by saving hash table lookups. Also added some of the lookup metrics to the default statsD emitter metric whitelist.\",\n",

Add tests: - `CoordinatorSimulationBaseTest`, `SegmentLoadingTest`, `SegmentBalancingTest` - `SegmentLoadingNegativeTest` to contain tests which assert the existing erroneous behaviour of segment loading. Once the behaviour is fixed, these tests will be moved to the regular `SegmentLoadingTest`.  Please refer to the README.md in `org.apache.druid.server.coordinator.simulate` for more details\",\n",

      "\t\t\"body\": \"* Various documentation updates.  1) Split out \\\"data management\\\" from \\\"ingestion\\\". Break it into thematic pages.  2) Move \\\"SQL-based ingestion\\\" into the Ingestion category. Adjust content so    all conceptual content is in concepts.md and all syntax content is in reference.md.    Shorten the known issues page to the most interesting ones.  3) Add SQL-based ingestion to the ingestion method comparison page. Remove the    index task, since index_parallel is just as good when maxNumConcurrentSubTasks: 1.  4) Rename various mentions of \\\"Druid console\\\" to \\\"web console\\\".  5) Add additional information to ingestion/partitioning.md.  6) Remove a mention of Tranquility.  7) Remove a note about upgrading to Druid 0.10.1.  8) Remove no-longer-relevant task types from ingestion/tasks.md.  9) Move ingestion/native-batch-firehose.md to the hidden section. It was previously deprecated.  10) Move ingestion/native-batch-simple-task.md to the hidden section. It is still linked in some     places, but it isn't very useful compared to index_parallel, so it shouldn't take up space     in the sidebar.  11) Make all br tags self-closing.  12) Certain other cosmetic changes.  13) Update to node-sass 7.  * make travis use node12 for docs  Co-authored-by: Vadim Ogievetsky <vadim@ogievetsky.com>\",\n",

But it also introduced a deadlock scenario as follows: - An invocation of `runInternal` is in progress. - A `stop` request comes, acquires `stateChangeLock` and submit a `ShutdownNotice` - `runInternal` keeps waiting to acquire the `stateChangeLock` - `ShutdownNotice` remains stuck in the notice queue because `runInternal` is still running - After some timeout, the supervisor goes through a forced termination  Fix:  * `SeekableStreamSupervisor.runInternal` - do not try to acquire lock if supervisor is already stopping  * `SupervisorStateManager.maybeSetState` - do not allow transitions from STOPPING state \",\n",

      "\t\t\"body\": \"* SQL: Fix round-trips of floating point literals.  When writing RexLiterals into Druid expressions, we now write non-integer numeric literals in such a way that ensures they are parsed as doubles on the other end.  * Updates from code review, and some additional stuff inspired by the investigation.  - Remove unnecessary formatting code from DruidExpression.doubleLiteral:   it handles things just fine with its default behavior.  - Fix a problem where expression literals could not represent Long.MIN_VALUE.   Now, integer literals start life off as BigIntegerExpr instead of LongExpr,   and are converted to LongExpr during flattening. This is necessary because,   in order to avoid ambiguity between unary minus and negative literals, our   grammar does not actually have true negative literals. Negative numbers must   be represented as unary minus next to a positive literal.  - Fix a bug  introduced in #12230 where shuttle.visitAll(args) delegated   to shuttle.visit(arg) instead of arg.visit(shuttle). The latter does   a recursive visitation, which is the intended behavior.  * Style fixes.  * Move regexp to the right place.\",\n",

This type helps in  absolute precision arithmetic on large numbers in applications,  where greater level of accuracy is required, such as financial  applications, currency based transactions. This helps avoid rounding  issues where in potentially large amount of money can be lost.  Accumulation requires that the two numbers have the same scale,  but does not require that they are of the same size. If the value  being accumulated has a larger underlying array than this value  (the result), then the higher order bits are dropped, similar to what  happens when adding a long to an int and storing the result in an  int. A compressed big decimal that holds its data with an embedded  array.  Compressed big decimal is an absolute number based complex type  based on big decimal in Java. This supports all the functionalities  supported by Java Big Decimal. Java Big Decimal is not mutable in  order to avoid big garbage collection issues. Compressed big decimal  is needed to mutate the value in the accumulator.\",\n",

Since it only supports maps up to Integer.MAX_VALUE, we also implement windowing in FrameFile, such that we can still handle large files.  Other changes:  1) Add two new \\\"map\\\" functions to FileUtils, which we use in this patch. 2) Add a footer checksum to the FrameFile format.

(Dependencies live in their \\\"official\\\" image.) - Maven module druid-it-cases that holds the revised tests and the framework itself. The framework includes file-based test configuration, test-specific clients, test initialization and updated versions of some of the common test support classes.  The integration test setup is primarily a huge mass of details. This approach refactors many of those details: from how the image is built and configured to how the Docker Compose scripts are structured to test configuration. An extensive set of \\\"readme\\\" files explains those details. Rather than repeat that material here, please consult those files for explanations.\",\n",

      "\t\t\"body\": \"* Fix race in TaskQueue.notifyStatus.  It was possible for manageInternal to relaunch a task while it was being cleaned up, due to a race that happens when notifyStatus is called to clean up a successful task:  1) In a critical section, notifyStatus removes the task from \\\"tasks\\\". 2) Outside a critical section, notifyStatus calls taskRunner.shutdown    to let the task runner know it can clear out its data structures. 3) In a critical section, syncFromStorage adds the task back to \\\"tasks\\\",    because it is still present in metadata storage. 4) In a critical section, manageInternalCritical notices that the task    is in \\\"tasks\\\" and is not running in the taskRunner, so it launches    it again. 5) In a (different) critical section, notifyStatus updates the metadata    store to set the task status to SUCCESS. 6) The task continues running even though it should not be.  The possibility for this race was introduced in #12099, which shrunk the critical section in notifyStatus. Prior to that patch, a single critical section encompassed (1), (2), and (5), so the ordering above was not possible.  This patch does the following:  1) Fixes the race by adding a recentlyCompletedTasks set that prevents    the main management loop from doing anything with tasks that are    currently being cleaned up. 2) Switches the order of the critical sections in notifyStatus, so    metadata store updates happen first. This is useful in case of    server failures: it ensures that if the Overlord fails in the midst    of notifyStatus, then completed-task statuses are still available in    ZK or on MMs for the next Overlord. (Those are cleaned up by    taskRunner.shutdown, which formerly ran first.) This isn't related    to the race described above, but is fixed opportunistically as part    of the same patch. 3) Changes the \\\"tasks\\\" list to a map. Many operations require retrieval    or removal of individual tasks; those are now O(1) instead of O(N)    in the number of running tasks. 4) Changes various log messages to use task ID instead of full task    payload, to make the logs more readable.  * Fix format string.  * Update comment.\",\n",

      "\t\t\"body\": \"* SQL: Morph QueryMakerFactory into SqlEngine.  Groundwork for introducing an indexing-service-task-based SQL engine under the umbrella of #12262. Also includes some other changes related to improving error behavior.  Main changes:  1) Elevate the QueryMakerFactory interface (an extension point that allows    customization of how queries are made) into SqlEngine. SQL engines    can influence planner behavior through EngineFeatures, and can fully    control the mechanics of query execution using QueryMakers.  2) Remove the server-wide QueryMakerFactory choice, in favor of the choice    being made by the SQL entrypoint. The indexing-service-task-based    SQL engine would be associated with its own entrypoint, like    /druid/v2/sql/task.  Other changes:  1) Adjust DruidPlanner to try either DRUID or BINDABLE convention based    on analysis of the planned rels; never try both. In particular, we    no longer try BINDABLE when DRUID fails. This simplifies the logic    and improves error messages.  2) Adjust error message \\\"Cannot build plan for query\\\" to omit the SQL    query text. Useful because the text can be quite long, which makes it    easy to miss the text about the problem.  3) Add a feature to block context parameters used internally by the SQL    planner from being supplied by end users.  4) Add a feature to enable adding row signature to the context for    Scan queries. This is useful in building the task-based engine.  5) Add saffron.properties file that turns off sets and graphviz dumps    in \\\"cannot plan\\\" errors. Significantly reduces log spam on the Broker.  * Fixes from CI.  * Changes from review.  * Can vectorize, now that join-to-filter is on by default.  * Checkstyle! And variable renames!  * Remove throws from test.\",\n",

In particular, this means the final processor in the    chain reports the root cause error, which ensures that someone with    a handle to the final processor will get the proper error.  2) Update FrameFileHttpResponseHandler to expect that the final fetch,    rather than being simply empty, is also empty with a special header.    This ensures that the handler is able to tell the difference between    an empty fetch due to being at EOF, and an empty fetch due to a    truncated HTTP response (after the 200 OK and headers are sent down,    but before any content appears).  * Fix tests, imports.  * Checkstyle!\",\n",

Hence, the idea of StorageConnector was born where the storage connector sits inside the druid core so all extensions have access to it.  Each deep storage implementation, for eg s3, GCS, will implement this interface. Now with some Jackson magic, we bind the implementation of the correct deep storage implementation on runtime using a type variable.\",\n",

      "\t\t\"body\": \"Refactors the DruidSchema and DruidTable abstractions to prepare for the Druid Catalog.  As we add the catalog, we\\u2019ll want to combine physical segment metadata information with \\u201chints\\u201d provided by the catalog. This is best done if we tidy up the existing code to more clearly separate responsibilities.  This PR is purely a refactoring move: no functionality changed. There is no difference to user functionality or external APIs. Functionality changes will come later as we add the catalog itself.  DruidSchema In the present code, DruidSchema does three tasks:  Holds the segment metadata cache Interfaces with an external schema manager Acts as a schema to Calcite This PR splits those responsibilities.  DruidSchema holds the Calcite schema for the druid namespace, combining information fro the segment metadata cache, from the external schema manager and (later) from the catalog. SegmentMetadataCache holds the segment metadata cache formerly in DruidSchema. DruidTable The present DruidTable class is a bit of a kitchen sink: it holds all the various kinds of tables which Druid supports, and uses if-statements to handle behavior that differs between types. Yet, any given DruidTable will handle only one such table type. To more clearly model the actual table types, we split DruidTable into several classes:  DruidTable becomes an abstract base class to hold Druid-specific methods. DatasourceTable represents a datasource. ExternalTable represents an external table, such as from EXTERN or (later) from the catalog. InlineTable represents the internal case in which we attach data directly to a table. LookupTable represents Druid\\u2019s lookup table mechanism. The new subclasses are more focused: they can be selective about the data they hold and the various predicates since they represent just one table type. This will be important as the catalog information will differ depending on table type and the new structure makes adding that logic cleaner.  DatasourceMetadata Previously, the DruidSchema segment cache would work with DruidTable objects. With the catalog, we need a layer between the segment metadata and the table as presented to Calcite. To fix this, the new SegmentMetadataCache class uses a new DatasourceMetadata class as its cache entry to hold only the \\u201cphysical\\u201d segment metadata information: it is up to the DruidTable to combine this with the catalog information in a later PR.  More Efficient Table Resolution Calcite provides a convenient base class for schema objects: AbstractSchema. However, this class is a bit too convenient: all we have to do is provide a map of tables and Calcite does the rest. This means that, to resolve any single datasource, say, foo, we need to cache segment metadata, external schema information, and catalog information for all tables. Just so Calcite can do a map lookup.  There is nothing special about AbstractSchema. We can handle table lookups ourselves. The new AbstractTableSchema does this. In fact, all the rest of Calcite wants is to resolve individual tables by name, and, for commands we don\\u2019t use, to provide a list of table names.  DruidSchema now extends AbstractTableSchema. SegmentMetadataCache resolves individual tables (and provides table names.)  DruidSchemaManager DruidSchemaManager provides a way to specify table schemas externally. In this sense, it is similar to the catalog, but only for datasources. It originally followed the AbstractSchema pattern: it implements provide a map of tables. This PR provides new optional methods for the table lookup and table names operations. The default implementations work the same way that AbstractSchema works: we get the entire map and pick out the information we need. Extensions that use this API should be revised to support the individual operations instead. Druid code no longer calls the original getTables() method.  The PR has one breaking change: since the DruidSchemaManager map is read-only to the rest of Druid, we should return a Map, not a ConcurrentMap.\",\n",

Even if this is satisified initially, resharding the stream can lead to empty intermediate shards. A significant delay in writing to newly created shards was also problematic.  Kinesis shard sequence numbers are big integers. Introduce two more custom sequence tokens UNREAD_TRIM_HORIZON and UNREAD_LATEST to indicate that a shard has not been read from and that it needs to be read from the start or the end respectively. These values can be used to avoid the need to read at least one record to obtain a sequence number for ingesting a newly discovered shard.  If a record cannot be obtained immediately, use a marker to obtain the relevant shardIterator and use this shardIterator to obtain a valid sequence number. As long as a valid sequence number is not obtained, continue storing the token as the offset.  These tokens (UNREAD_TRIM_HORIZON and UNREAD_LATEST) are logically ordered to be earlier than any valid sequence number.  However, the ordering requires a few subtle changes to the existing mechanism for record sequence validation:  The sequence availability check ensures that the current offset is before the earliest available sequence in the shard. However, current token being an UNREAD token indicates that any sequence number in the shard is valid (despite the ordering)  Kinesis sequence numbers are inclusive i.e if current sequence == end sequence, there are more records left to read. However, the equality check is exclusive when dealing with UNREAD tokens.\",\n",

This patch adds three new concepts:  1) Frame channels are interfaces for doing nonblocking reads and writes    of frames.  2) Frame processors are interfaces for doing nonblocking processing of    frames received from input channels and sent to output channels.  3) Cluster-by keys, which can be used for sorting or partitioning.  The patch also adds SuperSorter, a user of these concepts, both to illustrate how they are used, and also because it is going to be useful in future work.  Central classes:  - ReadableFrameChannel. Implementations include   BlockingQueueFrameChannel (in-memory channel that implements both interfaces),   ReadableFileFrameChannel (file-based channel),   ReadableByteChunksFrameChannel (byte-stream-based channel), and others.  - WritableFrameChannel. Implementations include BlockingQueueFrameChannel   and WritableStreamFrameChannel (byte-stream-based channel).  - ClusterBy, a sorting or partitioning key.  - FrameProcessor, nonblocking processor of frames. Implementations include   FrameChannelBatcher, FrameChannelMerger, and FrameChannelMuxer.  - FrameProcessorExecutor, an executor service that runs FrameProcessors.  - SuperSorter, a class that uses frame channels and processors to   do parallel external merge sort of any amount of data (as long as there   is enough disk space).  * Additional tests, fixes.  * Changes from review.  * Better implementation for ReadableInputStreamFrameChannel.  * Rename getFrameFileReference -> newFrameFileReference.  * Add InterruptedException to runIncrementally; add more tests.  * Cancellation adjustments.  * Review adjustments.  * Refactor BlockingQueueFrameChannel, rename doneReading and doneWriting to close.  * Additional changes from review.  * Additional changes.  * Fix test.  * Adjustments.  * Adjustments.\",\n",

This is often not a problem except when machines are super-beefy. Imagine a 64-core machine and 32 workers running on this machine. now you will have each Peon reporting metrics for each core. that's an increase of (32 * 64)x in the number of metrics.

Each of these monitors emits a set of metrics once every druid.monitoring.emissionPeriod. As a result, after executing several tasks for a while, Indexer emits metrics of these tasks even after they're long gone.  Proposed Solution Since one should be able to obtain the last round of ingestion metrics after the task unregisters the monitor, introducing lastRoundMetricsToBePushed variable to keep track of the same and overriding the AbstractMonitor.monitor method in RealtimeMetricsMonitor, TaskRealtimeMetricsMonitor to implement the new logic.\",\n",

This is not optimal, because it can lead to OOM on small servers and insufficient resource utilization on larger servers. It also invites end users to try to tune it when queries run out of dictionary space, which can make things worse if the end user sets it to too high.  So, this patch:  - Adds automatic tuning for selector and merge dictionaries. Selectors   use up to 15% of the heap and merge buffers use up to 30% of the heap   (aggregate across all queries).  - Updates out-of-memory error messages to emphasize enabling disk   spilling vs. increasing memory parameters. With the memory parameters   automatically sized, it is more likely that an end user will get   benefit from enabling disk spilling.  - Removes the query context parameters that allow lowering of configured   dictionary sizes. These complicate the calculation, and I don't see a   reasonable use case for them.  * Adjust tests.  * Review adjustments.  * Additional comment.  * Remove unused import.\",\n",

As we move towards query execution plans that involve more transfer of data between servers, it's important to have a data format that provides for doing this more efficiently than the options available to us today.  This patch adds:  - Columnar frames, which support fast querying. - Row-based frames, which support fast sorting via memory comparison   and fast whole-row copies via memory copying. - Frame files, a container format that can be stored on disk or   transferred between servers.  The idea is we should use row-based frames when data is expected to be sorted, and columnar frames when data is expected to be queried.  The code in this patch is not used in production yet. Therefore, the patch involves minimal changes outside of the org.apache.druid.frame package.  The main ones are adjustments to SqlBenchmark to add benchmarks for queries on frames, and the addition of a \\\"forEach\\\" method to Sequence.  * Fixes based on tests, static analysis.  * Additional fixes.  * Skip DS mapping tests on JDK 14+  * Better JDK checking in tests.  * Fix imports.  * Additional comment.  * Adjustments from code review.  * Update test case.\",\n",

      "\t\t\"body\": \"* Mid-level service client and updated high-level clients.  Our servers talk to each other over HTTP. We have a low-level HTTP client (HttpClient) that is super-asynchronous and super-customizable through its handlers. It's also proven to be quite robust: we use it for Broker -> Historical communication over the wide variety of query types and workloads we support.  But the low-level client has no facilities for service location or retries, which means we have a variety of high-level clients that implement these in their own ways. Some high-level clients do a better job than others. This patch adds a mid-level ServiceClient that makes it easier for high-level clients to be built correctly and harmoniously, and migrates some of the high-level logic to use ServiceClients.  Main changes:  1) Add ServiceClient org.apache.druid.rpc package. That package also    contains supporting stuff like ServiceLocator and RetryPolicy    interfaces, and a DiscoveryServiceLocator based on    DruidNodeDiscoveryProvider.  2) Add high-level OverlordClient in org.apache.druid.rpc.indexing.  3) Indexing task client creator in TaskServiceClients. It uses    SpecificTaskServiceLocator to find the tasks. This improves on    ClientInfoTaskProvider by caching task locations for up to 30 seconds    across calls, reducing load on the Overlord.  4) Rework ParallelIndexSupervisorTaskClient to use a ServiceClient    instead of extending IndexTaskClient.  5) Rework RemoteTaskActionClient to use a ServiceClient instead of    DruidLeaderClient.  6) Rework LocalIntermediaryDataManager, TaskMonitor, and    ParallelIndexSupervisorTask. As a result, MiddleManager, Peon, and    Overlord no longer need IndexingServiceClient (which internally used    DruidLeaderClient).  There are some concrete benefits over the prior logic, namely:  - DruidLeaderClient does retries in its \\\"go\\\" method, but only retries   exactly 5 times, does not sleep between retries, and does not retry   retryable HTTP codes like 502, 503, 504. (It only retries IOExceptions.)   ServiceClient handles retries in a more reasonable way.  - DruidLeaderClient's methods are all synchronous, whereas ServiceClient   methods are asynchronous. This is used in one place so far: the   SpecificTaskServiceLocator, so we don't need to block a thread trying   to locate a task. It can be used in other places in the future.  - HttpIndexingServiceClient does not properly handle all server errors.   In some cases, it tries to parse a server error as a successful   response (for example: in getTaskStatus).  - IndexTaskClient currently makes an Overlord call on every task-to-task   HTTP request, as a way to find where the target task is. ServiceClient,   through SpecificTaskServiceLocator, caches these target locations   for a period of time.  * Style adjustments.  * For the coverage.  * Adjustments.  * Better behaviors.  * Fixes.\",\n",

This race means that, depending on interleaving of tests, if the very last time that an object is checked out from the pool leaks, then it won't get caught.

This query tries to fetch several columns, including payload, of all the rows at once. This introduces a significant memory overhead and can cause unresponsiveness or overlord failure when the ingestion tab is opened multiple times (due to several parallel calls to this API)  Another thing to note is that the task table (the payload column in particular) can be very large. Extracting large payloads from such tables can be very slow, leading to slow UI. While we are fixing the memory pressure in the overlord, we can also fix the slowness in UI caused by fetching large payloads from the table. Fetching large payloads also puts pressure on the metadata store as reported in the community (Metadata store query performance degrades as the tasks in druid_tasks table grows \\u00b7 Issue #12318 \\u00b7 apache/druid )  The task summaries returned as a response for the API are several times smaller and can fit comfortably in memory. So, there is an opportunity here to fix the memory usage, slow ingestion, and under-pressure metadata store by removing the need to handle large payloads in every layer we can. Of course, the solution becomes complex as we try to fix more layers. With that in mind, this page captures two approaches. They vary in complexity and also in the degree to which they fix the aforementioned problems.\",\n",

Query is marked with @ExtensionPoint, and lately we have been trying to be less volatile on these interfaces by providing default implementations to be more chill for extension writers.  The way this default implementation is done in this PR is a bit strange due to the way that getQueryContext is used (mutated with system default and system generated keys); the default implementation has a specific object that it returns, and I added another temporary default method isLegacyContext that checks if the getQueryContext returns that object or not. If not, callers fall back to using getContext and withOverriddenContext to set these default and system values.  I am open to other ideas as well, but this way should work at least without exploding, and added some tests to ensure that it is wired up correctly for QueryLifecycle, including the context authorization stuff.  The added test shows the strange behavior if query context authorization is enabled, mainly that the system default and system generated query context keys also need to be granted as permissions for things to function correctly. This is not great, so I mentioned it in the javadocs as well. Not sure if it needs to be called out anywhere else.\",\n",

Use valuesUtf8 whenever possible. If    necessary, the input set is copied into a ValuesSet. Much logic is    simplified, because we always know what type the values set will be.    I think that there won't even be an efficiency loss in most cases.    InDimFilter is most frequently created by deserialization, and this    patch updates the JsonCreator constructor to deserialize    directly into a ValuesSet.  2) Add Utf8ValueSetIndex, which InDimFilter uses to avoid UTF-8 decodes    during index lookups.  3) Add unsigned comparator to ByteBufferUtils and use it in    GenericIndexed.BYTE_BUFFER_STRATEGY. This is important because UTF-8    bytes can be compared as bytes if, and only if, the comparison    is unsigned.  4) Add specialization to GenericIndexed.singleThreaded().indexOf that    avoids needless ByteBuffer allocations.  5) Clarify that objects returned by ColumnIndexSupplier.as are not    thread-safe. DictionaryEncodedStringIndexSupplier now calls    singleThreaded() on all relevant GenericIndexed objects, saving    a ByteBuffer allocation per access.  Also:  1) Fix performance regression in LikeFilter: since #12315, it applied    the suffix matcher to all values in range even for type MATCH_ALL.  2) Add ObjectStrategy.canCompare() method. This fixes LikeFilterBenchmark,    which was broken due to calls to strategy.compare in    GenericIndexed.fromIterable.  * Add like-filter implementation tests.  * Add in-filter implementation tests.  * Add tests, fix issues.  * Fix style.  * Adjustments from review.\",\n",

There's only one case I'm aware of where this may be a net negative: for time_floor(__time, <period>) where there are many repeated __time values. In nonvectorized processing, SingleLongInputCachingExpressionColumnValueSelector implements an optimization to avoid computing the time_floor function on every row. There is no such optimization in vectorized processing.  IMO, we shouldn't mention this in the docs. Rationale: It's too fiddly of a thing: it's not guaranteed that nonvectorized processing will be faster due to the optimization, because it would have to overcome the inherent speed advantage of vectorization. So it'd always require testing to determine the best setting for a specific dataset. It would be bad if users disabled vectorization thinking it would speed up their queries, and it actually slowed them down. And even if users do their own testing, at some point in the future we'll implement the optimization for vectorized processing too, and it's likely that users that explicitly disabled vectorization will continue to have it disabled. I'd like to avoid this outcome by encouraging all users to enable vectorization at all times. Really advanced users would be following development activity anyway, and can read this issue \",\n",

A cluster operator can also disregard the druid.coordinator.kill.durationToRetain entirely by setting a new configuration, druid.coordinator.kill.ignoreDurationToRetain=true. This ignores interval_end date when looking for segments to kill, and instead is capable of killing any segment marked unused.

Two main changes:  1) Reuse Entry objects returned by various implementations of    Grouper.iterator.  2) Reuse key objects contained within those Entry objects.  This is allowed by the contract, which states that entries must be processed and immediately discarded. However, not all call sites respected this, so this patch also updates those call sites.  One particularly sneaky way that the old code retained entries too long is due to Guava's MergingIterator and CombiningIterator. Internally, these both advance to the next value prior to returning the current value. So, this patch addresses that in two ways:  1) For merging, we have our own implementation MergeIterator already,    although it had the same problem. So, this patch updates our    implementation to return the current item prior to advancing to the    next item. It also adds a forbidden-api entry to ensure that this    safer implementation is used instead of Guava's.  2) For combining, we address the problem in a different way: by copying    the key when creating the new, combined entry.  * Attempt to fix test.  * Remove unused import.\",\n",

This patch attacks two sources of allocations during Jackson serialization:  1) ObjectMapper.writeValue and JsonGenerator.writeObject create a new    DefaultSerializerProvider instance for each call. It has lots of    fields and creates pressure on the garbage collector. So, this patch    adds helper functions in JacksonUtils that enable reuse of    SerializerProvider objects and updates various call sites to make    use of this.  2) GroupByQueryToolChest copies the ObjectMapper for every query to    install a special module that supports backwards compatibility with    map-based rows. This isn't needed if resultAsArray is set and    all servers are running Druid 0.16.0 or later. This release was a    while ago. So, this patch disables backwards compatibility by default,    which eliminates the need to copy the heavyweight ObjectMapper. The    patch also introduces a configuration option that allows admins to    explicitly enable backwards compatibility.  * Add test.  * Update additional call sites and add to forbidden APIs.\",\n",

      "\t\t\"body\": \"The query context is a way that the user gives a hint to the Druid query engine, so that they enforce a certain behavior or at least let the query engine prefer a certain plan during query planning. Today, there are 3 types of query context params as below.  Default context params. They are set via druid.query.default.context in runtime properties. Any user context params can be default params. User context params. They are set in the user query request. See https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/query-context.html for parameters. System context params. They are set by the Druid query engine during query processing. These params override other context params. Today, any context params are allowed to users. This can cause  1) a bad UX if the context param is not matured yet or  2) even query failure or system fault in the worst case if a sensitive param is abused, ex) maxSubqueryRows.  This PR adds an ability to limit context params per user role. That means, a query will fail if you have a context param set in the query that is not allowed to you. To do that, this PR adds a new built-in resource type, QUERY_CONTEXT. The resource to authorize has a name of the context param (such as maxSubqueryRows) and the type of QUERY_CONTEXT. To allow a certain context param for a user, the user should be granted WRITE permission on the context param resource. Here is an example of the permission.  {   \\\"resourceAction\\\" : {     \\\"resource\\\" : {       \\\"name\\\" : \\\"maxSubqueryRows\\\",       \\\"type\\\" : \\\"QUERY_CONTEXT\\\"     },     \\\"action\\\" : \\\"WRITE\\\"   },   \\\"resourceNamePattern\\\" : \\\"maxSubqueryRows\\\" } Each role can have multiple permissions for context params. Each permission should be set for different context params.  When a query is issued with a query context X, the query will fail if the user who issued the query does not have WRITE permission on the query context X. In this case,  HTTP endpoints will return 403 response code. JDBC will throw ForbiddenException. Note: there is a context param called brokerService that is used only by the router. This param is used to pin your query to run it in a specific broker. Because the authorization is done not in the router, but in the broker, if you have brokerService set in your query without a proper permission, your query will fail in the broker after routing is done. Technically, this is not right because the authorization is checked after the context param takes effect. However, this should not cause any user-facing issue and thus should be OK. The query will still fail if the user doesn\\u2019t have permission for brokerService.  The context param authorization can be enabled using druid.auth.authorizeQueryContextParams. This is disabled by default to avoid any hassle when someone upgrades his cluster blindly without reading release notes.\",\n",

Changes - Extract `StringDistribution` from `DimensionDistributionReport`s when they are received   and write to disk inside the task/temp/distributions - After all the subtasks have finished, iterate over all the intervals one by one - For each interval, read the distributions from disk, merge them and create `PartitionBoundaries`. - Cleanup task/temp/distributions directory when all `PartitionBoundaries` have been determined\",\n",

In particular, they can error out for various reasons leading to what would normally be seen as an invalid result.  The Druid kubernetes node discovery subsystem does not handle a certain case properly. The watch can return an item with a null object.  These leads to a null pointer exception. When this happens, the provider needs to restart the watch, because rerunning the watch from the same resource version leads to the same result: yet another null pointer exception.  This commit changes the provider to handle null objects by restarting the watch.  * review: add more coverage  This adds a bit more coverage to the K8sDruidNodeDiscoveryProvider watch loop, and removes an unnecessay return.  * kubernetes: reduce logging verbosity  The log messages about items being NULL don't really deserve to be at a level other than DEBUG since they are not actionable, particularly since we automatically recover now. Move them to the DEBUG level.\",\n",

      "\t\t\"body\": \"Add config for eager / lazy connection initialization in ResourcePool  Description Currently, when multiple tasks are launched, each of them eagerly initializes a full pool's worth of connections to the coordinator.  While this is acceptable when the parameter for number of eagerConnections (== maxSize) is small, this can be problematic in environments where it's a large value (say 1000) and multiple tasks are launched simultaneously, which can cause a large number of connections to be created to the coordinator, thereby overwhelming it.  Patch Nodes like the broker may require eager initialization of resources and do not create connections with the Coordinator. It is unnecessary to do this with other types of nodes.  A config parameter eagerInitialization is added, which when set to true, initializes the max permissible connections when ResourcePool is initialized.  If set to false, lazy initialization of connection resources takes place.  NOTE: All nodes except the broker have this new parameter set to false in the quickstart as part of this PR  Algorithm The current implementation relies on the creation of maxSize resources eagerly.  The new implementation's behaviour is as follows:  If a resource has been previously created and is available, lend it. Else if the number of created resources is less than the allowed parameter, create and lend it. Else, wait for one of the lent resources to be returned.\",\n",

IntermediateRowParsingReader#read() now attaches the InputEntity and the \\\"record number\\\" which created the exception (while parsing them), and IntermediateRowParsingReader#sample attaches the InputEntity (but not the \\\"record number\\\"). TextReader (and its subclasses), which is a specific implementation of the IntermediateRowParsingReader also include the line number which caused the generation of the error.

The method that's changed is part of the integration test suite and only used by the test cases that we've seen are flaky.  Prior to this change, the tests expected a sharding operation to start in 9 seconds (30 retries * 300ms delay/retry). This change bumps the number of retries to 100, giving Kinesis 30 seconds to start the sharding.  This PR also makes a small, clarifying change to the condition used to determine if sharding has started. Instead of checking if the number of shards has increased (which was technically correct even if the test is reducing the number of shards due to a Kinesis implementation detail), we now just check if the shard count has changed.\",\n",

This PR replaces the max estimation mechanism with getting the incremental memory used by the aggregator or indexer at each invocation of `aggregate` or `encode` respectively.  ### Changes - Add new flag `useMaxMemoryEstimates` in the task context. This overrides the same flag in DefaultTaskConfig i.e. `druid.indexer.task.default.context` map - Add method `AggregatorFactory.factorizeWithSize()` that returns an `AggregatorAndSize` which contains   the aggregator instance and the estimated initial size of the aggregator - Add method `Aggregator.aggregateWithSize()` which returns the incremental memory used by this aggregation step - Update the method `DimensionIndexer.processRowValsToKeyComponent()` to return the encoded key component as well as its effective size in bytes - Update `OnHeapIncrementalIndex` to use the new estimations only if `useMaxMemoryEstimates = false`\",\n",

RowSignature already allows null column type for any column. Doing so should also fix bindable queries such as select (1,2). When such queries are run with headers set to true, we get an exception in org.apache.druid.sql.http.ArrayWriter#writeHeader. This is again a similar exception to the one addressed in this PR.

The flag determines how queries which contain an aggregation over `DISTINCT` like `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT foo.dim1) FILTER(WHERE foo.cnt = 1), SUM(foo.cnt) FROM druid.foo` get planned by Calcite. With the flag being set to false, it plans it via joins, whereas with it being set to true, the query is set using grouping sets.  There is a known issue with Calcite (https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7953), where an NPE is thrown while planning the above query with joins. There is no such issue while planning the query using grouping sets.\",\n",

Before the PR, it returned no row, after the PR, it would return a row with value of count(*) as 0 (as expected by SQL standards of different dbs).  In Grouping#applyProject, we can sometimes perform optimization of a groupBy query to a timeseries query if possible (when the keys of the groupBy are constants, as generated by automated tools). For example, in select count(*) from table where dim1=\\\"_present_dim_\\\" group by \\\"dummy_key\\\", the groupBy clause can be removed. However, in the case when the filter doesn't return anything, i.e. select count(*) from table where dim1=\\\"_not_present_dim_\\\" group by \\\"dummy_key\\\", the behavior of general databases would be to return nothing, while druid (due to above change) returns an empty row. This PR aims to fix this divergence of behavior.  Example cases:  select count(*) from table where dim1=\\\"_not_present_dim_\\\" group by \\\"dummy_key\\\". CURRENT: Returns a row with count(*) = 0 EXPECTED: Return no row  select 'A', dim1 from foo where m1 = 123123 and dim1 = '_not_present_again_' group by dim1 CURRENT: Returns a row with ('A', 'wat') EXPECTED: Return no row  To do this, a boolean droppedDimensionsWhileApplyingProject has been added to Grouping which is true whenever we make changes to the original shape with optimization. Hence if a timeseries query has a grouping with this set to true, we set skipEmptyBuckets=true in the query context (i.e. donot return any row).  \",\n",

This config should actually be the default, but it is added as a config to enable a smooth transition/validation in production settings before forcing it as the default behavior going forward.  This change leverages the TaskLockType.SHARED that existed previously, this used to carry the semantics of a READ lock, which was \\\"escalated\\\" when the task wanted to actually persist the segment.  As of many moons before this diff, the SHARED lock had stopped being used but was still piped into the code.  It turns out that with a few tweaks, it can be adjusted to be a shared lock for append tasks to allow them all to write to the same datasource, so that is what this does.  * Can only reuse the shared lock if using the same groupId  * Need to serialize out the task lock type  * Adjust Unit tests to expect new field in JSON\",\n",

The failure occurs because the peon and other leaf nodes (broker, historical), have retry logic that continues to retry the lookup loading for 3 minutes by default. The http listener thread on the peon task is not started until lookup loading completes, by default, the overlord waits 1 minute by default, to communicate with the peon task to get the task status, after which is orders the task to shut down, causing the ingestion task to fail.  To fix the issue, we catch the exception serialization error, and do not retry. Also fixed an issue in which a bad lookup config interferes with any other good lookup configs from being loaded.\",\n",

      "\t\t\"body\": \"This PR does two things  1. It adds the capability to surface missing features in SQL to users - The calcite planner will explore through multiple rules to convert a logical SQL query to a druid native query. Some rules change the shape of the query itself, optimize it and some rules are responsible for translating the query into a druid native query. These are DruidQueryRule, DruidOuterQueryRule, DruidJoinRule, DruidUnionDataSourceRule, DruidUnionRule etc. These rules will look at SQL and will do the necessary transformation. But if the rule can't transform the query, it returns back the control to the calcite planner without recording why was it not able to transform. E.g. there is a join query with a non-equal join condition. DruidJoinRule will look at the condition, see that it is not supported, and return back the control. The reason can be that a query can be planned in many different ways so if one rule can't parse it, the query may still be parseable by other rules. In this PR, we are intercepting these gaps and passing them back to the user if the query could not be planned at all.  2. The said capability has been used to generate actionable errors for some common unsupported SQL features. However, not all possible errors are covered and we can keep adding more in the future.\",\n",

      "\t\t\"body\": \"Druid currently has 2 serverViews, regular serverView and filtered serverView. The regular serverView is used to monitor all segment announcements from all data nodes (historicals, tasks, indexers). The filtered serverView is used when you want to watch segment announcements from particular tiers. Since these server views keep track of different sets of druidServers and segments in memory, they should be maintained separately. However, they currently share the same name for their executorService, which can cause confusion and make debugging harder especially in the broker since it is using both serverViews, the filtered view for normal query processing and the regular view to serve the servers table (I'm unsure whether this is intended or whether this is a good behavior). This PR changes it to a more obvious name.  This PR also removes SingleServerInventoryView. This view was deprecated a long time ago and has not been documented at least since 0.13 (#6127). I also don't think this can be better in any case than BatchServerInventoryView. Finally, I merged AbstractCuratorServerInventoryView and BatchServerInventoryView as we no longer need AbstractCuratorServerInventoryView after SingleServerInventoryView is removed.\",\n",

The idea is that at ingestion time, the number of rows that go into an aggregator will be 1 (if rollup is off) or will likely be a small number (if rollup is on).  It's a heuristic, because of course nothing guarantees that the rollup ratio is a small number. But it's a common case, and I expect this logic to go wrong much less often than the current logic. Also, when it does go wrong, users can fix it by lowering maxRowsInMemory or maxBytesInMemory. The current situation is unintuitive: when the estimation goes wrong, users get an OOME, but actually they need to *raise* these limits to fix it.\",\n",

      "\t\t\"body\": \"* SQL INSERT planner support.  The main changes are:  1) DruidPlanner is able to validate and authorize INSERT queries. They    require WRITE permission on the target datasource.  2) QueryMaker is now an interface, and there is a QueryMakerFactory that    creates instances of it. There is only one production implementation    of each (NativeQueryMaker and NativeQueryMakerFactory), which    together behave the same way as the former QueryMaker class. But this    opens the door to executing queries in ways other than the Druid    query stack, and is used by unit tests (CalciteInsertDmlTest) to    test the INSERT planning functionality.  3) Adds an EXTERN table macro that allows references external data using    InputSource and InputFormat from Druid's batch ingestion API. This is    not exposed in production yet, but is used by unit tests.  4) Adds a QueryFeature concept that enables the planner to change its    behavior slightly depending on the capabilities of the execution    system.  5) Adds an \\\"AuthorizableOperator\\\" concept that enables SqlOperators    to require additional permissions. This is used by the EXTERN table    macro.  Related odds and ends:  - Add equals, hashCode, toString methods to InlineInputSource. Aids in   the \\\"from external\\\" tests in CalciteInsertDmlTest. - Add JSON-serializability to RowSignature. - Move the SQL string inside PlannerContext so it is \\\"baked into\\\" the   planner when the planner is created. Cleans up the code a bit, since   in practice, the same query is passed in every time to the   same planner anyway.  * Fix up calls to CalciteTests.createMockQueryLifecycleFactory.  * Fix checkstyle issues.  * Adjustments for CI.  * Adjust DruidAvaticaHandlerTest for stricter test authorizations.\",\n",

Rationale: the behavior of wikipedia_index_task.json is order-dependent with regard to its input files; some orders produce 4 segments and some produce 5 segments. Some integration tests, like ITSystemTableBatchIndexTaskTest and ITAutoCompactionTest, are written assuming that the 4-segment case will always happen. Providing the file list in a specific order ensures that this will happen as expected by the tests.  I didn't see a specific reason why the LocalInputSource.files parameter needed to be a Set, so changing it to a List was the simplest way to achieve the consistent ordering. I think it will also make the behavior make more sense if someone does specify the same input file multiple times in a spec: I think they'd expect it to be loaded multiple times instead of deduped. This is consistent with the behavior of other input sources like S3, GCS, HTTP.  * Sort files in LocalFirehoseFactory.\",\n",

The changes are done in such a way that no matter how Scan query objects are constructed, they will have a correct \\\"getOrderBy\\\". This will enable us to switch the execution to exclusively use \\\"getOrderBy\\\" later on when it's implemented.  Scan queries are serialized such that they only include \\\"order\\\" (time order) if the ordering is time-based, and they only include \\\"orderBy\\\" if the ordering is non-time-based. This maximizes compatibility with the existing API while also providing a clean look for formatted queries.  Because this patch does not include execution logic, if someone actually tries to run a query with non-time ordering, then they will get an error like \\\"Cannot execute query with orderBy [quality ASC]\\\".  * SQL module fixes.  * Add spotbugs-exclude.  * Remove unused method.\",\n",

      "\t\t\"body\": \"Enhanced the ExtractionNamespace interface in lookups-cached-global core extension with the ability to set a maxHeapPercentage for the cache of the respective namespace. The reason for adding this functionality, is make it easier to detect when a lookup table grows to a size that the underlying service cannot handle, because it does not have enough memory. The default value of maxHeap for the interface is -1, which indicates that no maxHeapPercentage has been set. For the JdbcExtractionNamespace and UriExtractionNamespace implementations, the default value is null, which will cause the respective service that the lookup is loaded in, to warn when its cache is beyond mxHeapPercentage of the service's configured max heap size. If a positive non-null value is set for the namespace's maxHeapPercentage config, this value will be honored for all services that the respective lookup is loaded onto, and consequently log warning messages when the cache of the respective lookup grows beyond this respective percentage of the services configured max heap size. Warnings are logged every time that either Uri based or Jdbc based lookups are regenerated, if the maxHeapPercentage constraint is violated. No other implementations will log warnings at this time. No error is thrown when the size exceeds the maxHeapPercentage at this time, as doing so could break functionality for existing users. Previously the JdbcCacheGenerator generated its cache by materializing all rows of the underling table in memory at once; this made it difficult to log warning messages in the case that the results from the jdbc query were very large and caused the service to run out of memory. To help with this, this pr makes it so that the jdbc query results are instead streamed through an iterator.\",\n",

      "\t\t\"body\": \"* Remove OffheapIncrementalIndex and clarify aggregator thread-safety needs.  This patch does the following:  - Removes OffheapIncrementalIndex. - Clarifies that Aggregators are required to be thread safe. - Clarifies that BufferAggregators and VectorAggregators are not   required to be thread safe. - Removes thread safety code from some DataSketches aggregators that   had it. (Not all of them did, and that's OK, because it wasn't necessary   anyway.) - Makes enabling \\\"useOffheap\\\" with groupBy v1 an error.  Rationale for removing the offheap incremental index:  - It is only used in one rare scenario: groupBy v1 (which is non-default)   in \\\"useOffheap\\\" mode (also non-default). So you have to go pretty deep   into the wilderness to get this code to activate in production. It is   never used during ingestion. - Its existence complicates developer efforts to reason about how   aggregators get used, because the way it uses buffer aggregators is so   different from how every other query engine uses them. - It doesn't have meaningful testing.  By the way, I do believe that the given way the offheap incremental index works, it actually didn't require buffer aggregators to be thread-safe. It synchronizes on \\\"aggregate\\\" and doesn't call \\\"get\\\" until it has stopped calling \\\"aggregate\\\". Nevertheless, this is a bother to think about, and for the above reasons I think it makes sense to remove the code anyway.  * Remove things that are now unused.  * Revert removal of getFloat, getLong, getDouble from BufferAggregator.  * OAK-related warnings, suppressions.  * Unused item suppressions.\",\n",

      "\t\t\"body\": \"* SQL: Allow Scans to be used as outer queries.  This has been possible in the native query system for a while, but the capability hasn't yet propagated into the SQL layer. One example of where this is useful is a query like:    SELECT * FROM (... LIMIT X) WHERE <filter>  Because this expands the kinds of subquery structures the SQL layer will consider, it was also necessary to improve the cost calculations. These changes appear in PartialDruidQuery and DruidOuterQueryRel. The ideas are:  - Attach per-column penalties to the output signature of each query, instead of to   the initial projection that starts a query. This encourages moving projections   into subqueries instead of leaving them on outer queries. - Only attach penalties to projections if there are actually expressions happening.   So, now, projections that simply reorder or remove fields are free. - Attach a constant penalty to every outer query. This discourages creating them   when they are not needed.  The changes are generally beneficial to the test cases we have in CalciteQueryTest. Most plans are unchanged, or are changed in purely cosmetic ways. Two have changed for the better:  - testUsingSubqueryWithLimit now returns a constant from the subquery, instead of   returning every column. - testJoinOuterGroupByAndSubqueryHasLimit returns a minimal set of columns from   the innermost subquery; two unnecessary columns are no longer there.  * Fix various DS operator conversions.  These were all implemented as direct conversions, which isn't appropriate because they do not actually map onto native functions. These are only usable as post-aggregations.  * Test case adjustment.\",\n",

      "\t\t\"body\": \"### Description  Today we ingest a number of high cardinality metrics into Druid across dimensions. These metrics are rolled up on a per minute basis, and are very useful when looking at metrics on a partition or client basis. Events is another class of data that provides useful information about a particular incident/scenario inside a Kafka cluster. Events themselves are carried inside kafka payload, but nonetheless there are some very useful metadata that is carried in kafka headers that can serve as useful dimension for aggregation and in turn bringing better insights.  PR(https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10730) introduced support of Kafka headers in InputFormats.  We still need an input format to parse out the headers and translate those into relevant columns in Druid. Until that\\u2019s implemented, none of the information available in the Kafka message headers would be exposed. So first there is a need to write an input format that can parse headers in any given format(provided we support the format) like we parse payloads today. Apart from headers there is also some useful information present in the key portion of the kafka record. We also need a way to expose the data present in the key as druid columns. We need a generic way to express at configuration time what attributes from headers, key and payload need to be ingested into druid. We need to keep the design generic enough so that users can specify different parsers for headers, key and payload.  This PR is designed to solve the above by providing wrapper around any existing input formats and merging the data into a single unified Druid row.  Lets look at a sample input format from the above discussion  \\\"inputFormat\\\": {     \\\"type\\\": \\\"kafka\\\",     // New input format type     \\\"headerLabelPrefix\\\": \\\"kafka.header.\\\",   // Label prefix for header columns, this will avoid collusions while merging columns     \\\"recordTimestampLabelPrefix\\\": \\\"kafka.\\\",  // Kafka record's timestamp is made available in case payload does not carry timestamp     \\\"headerFormat\\\":  // Header parser specifying that values are of type string     {         \\\"type\\\": \\\"string\\\"     },     \\\"valueFormat\\\": // Value parser from json parsing     {         \\\"type\\\": \\\"json\\\",         \\\"flattenSpec\\\": {           \\\"useFieldDiscovery\\\": true,           \\\"fields\\\": [...]         }     },     \\\"keyFormat\\\":  // Key parser also from json parsing     {         \\\"type\\\": \\\"json\\\"     } }  Since we have independent sections for header, key and payload, it will enable parsing each section with its own parser, eg., headers coming in as string and payload as json.   KafkaInputFormat will be the uber class extending inputFormat interface and will be responsible for creating individual parsers for header, key and payload, blend the data resolving conflicts in columns and generating a single unified InputRow for Druid ingestion.   \\\"headerFormat\\\" will allow users to plug parser type for the header values and will add default header prefix as \\\"kafka.header.\\\"(can be overridden) for attributes to avoid collision while merging attributes with payload.  Kafka payload parser will be responsible for parsing the Value portion of the Kafka record. This is where most of the data will come from and we should be able to plugin existing parser. One thing to note here is that if batching is performed, then the code is augmenting header and key values to every record in the batch.  Kafka key parser will handle parsing Key portion of the Kafka record and will ingest the Key with dimension name as \\\"kafka.key\\\".  ## KafkaInputFormat Class:  This is the class that orchestrates sending the consumerRecord to each parser, retrieve rows, merge the columns into one final row for Druid consumption. KafkaInputformat should make sure to release the resources that gets allocated as a part of reader in CloseableIterator<InputRow> during normal and exception cases.  During conflicts in dimension/metrics names, the code will prefer dimension names from payload and ignore the dimension either from headers/key. This is done so that existing input formats can be easily migrated to this new format without worrying about losing information.\",\n",
