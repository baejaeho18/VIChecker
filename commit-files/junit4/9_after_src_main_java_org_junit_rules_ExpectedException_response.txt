The provided code does not seem to exhibit any known Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) issues.

However, please note that not all vulnerabilities have associated CWE or CVE numbers, and the lack of recognized vulnerabilities does not necessarily mean the code is entirely safe or secure. It's important to thoroughly review and test all code for potential issues.

Also, keep in mind that runtime security depends on the way how your application is configured and how this code is used in a broader context. Consider using software composition analysis tools to make sure that all your dependencies, including JUnit, are up to date and don't have known vulnerabilities.
