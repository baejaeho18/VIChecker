This appears to be a code for a testing framework - JUnit. The code itself doesn't seem to contain any known cyber vulnerabilities classified under Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers. 

Just keep in mind that testimony of a given piece of code does not mean the entire application is secure. The security of an entire application depends not only on the code but also on things like the environment it runs in, the security of its dependencies, how it handles data, etc. 

Because of such a small amount of context, I can't definitively say that all uses of this class will be secure. For example, any data this class takes as input should be appropriately checked for security issues. Also, just because the class itself doesn't have any security vulnerabilities doesn't mean its use will be vulnerability-free. An improper use can still introduce security issues into your application.

In short, it's always important to view code in context and understand the bigger picture when dealing with software security. It's often the interactions between components where the vulnerabilities sneak in.
