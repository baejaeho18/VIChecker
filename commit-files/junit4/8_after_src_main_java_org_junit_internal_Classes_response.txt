The code you posted does not have any explicit CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) vulnerabilities. 

However, depending on how the `getClass` methods are used in a wider context, there could be potential security risks. One potential issue could be CWE-470: Uncontrolled Search Path Element. This is a vulnerability that occurs when the software uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but the path can be controlled by an attacker.

In this case, the method `getClass` uses the current thread's Context Class Loader to load a class from a given class name. If the Context Class Loader or the class name is somehow manipulated by an attacker, this could lead to loading and executing arbitrary classes.

Please note that identifying a CWE or CVE vulnerability usually requires understanding the broader context, how the software is being used and the wider environment, which is not given in your provided code snippet. Always validate your code with a comprehensive testing and validation process, and consider getting a security audit for your application if you're concerned about security vulnerabilities.
