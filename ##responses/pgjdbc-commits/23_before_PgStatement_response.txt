Upon reviewing the code, I did not find any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, it's always a good practice to validate user input and perform proper input sanitization to avoid potential security risks such as SQL injection. Additionally, ensuring secure connection handling and authentication mechanisms are also crucial.
