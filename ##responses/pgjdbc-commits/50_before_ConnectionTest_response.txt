Based on the provided code, I couldn't identify any specific CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities.

However, it's important to note that the code lacks input validation and error handling for SQL queries and connections. This can lead to security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection attacks. It is recommended to implement input validation and use parameterized queries or prepared statements to avoid such vulnerabilities.
