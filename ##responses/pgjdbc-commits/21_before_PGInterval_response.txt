The code doesn't have any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, here are a few improvements that can be made:

1. Input Validation: The code doesn't perform any input validation when parsing the input value. It directly converts strings to integers and doubles without checking if they are valid numeric values. This can lead to NumberFormatException if the input string is not in the expected format. Input validation should be added to handle such cases gracefully.

2. Error Handling: The code throws a generic SQLException when a NumberFormatException occurs during parsing. It would be more informative to throw a more specific exception that indicates the failure to convert the value into the expected format.

3. SQL Injection: The code includes the possibility of using the input value directly in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. It's recommended to use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent this issue.

4. Code Formatting: The code has inconsistent indentation and spacing, which can make it harder to read and understand. Consistent formatting should be applied for better code readability.

Although these are not specific CWE or CVE vulnerabilities, addressing these improvements would enhance the code's quality and reduce the potential for vulnerabilities and bugs.
