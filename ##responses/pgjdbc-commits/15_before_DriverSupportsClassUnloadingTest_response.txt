Based on the provided code, I couldn't find any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, keep in mind that the absence of CWE or CVE vulnerabilities does not guarantee that the code is completely secure. It is always important to conduct a thorough security review and testing of the entire application, including its dependencies, to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
