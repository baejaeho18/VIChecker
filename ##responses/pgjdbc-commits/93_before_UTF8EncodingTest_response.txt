The code you provided does not contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. However, it is important to note that the code is missing some context, such as the definitions and implementations of the `Encoding` class and its methods.

Without the complete code and more information about the `Encoding` class, it is difficult to determine if there are any potential vulnerabilities related to input validation, data sanitization, or secure coding practices. It is recommended to review the implementation of the `Encoding` class and consider factors such as input validation, proper handling of sensitive data, and secure coding practices to ensure the code is free from vulnerabilities.
