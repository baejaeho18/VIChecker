The code provided does not contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. However, there are some best practices that could be improved:

1. SQL Injection: The code uses string concatenation to construct the INSERT_SQL statement, which may lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the SECRET_VALUE variable is not properly sanitized. It is recommended to use prepared statements and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

2. Resource Management: The code opens a database connection but does not use a try-with-resources block to ensure that the connection is properly closed in case of an exception. It is recommended to use try-with-resources to automatically close the connection.

3. Error Handling: The code catches SQLException but only asserts the SQL state and returns the error message. It is recommended to log or handle the exception appropriately and provide useful error messages or error handling logic.

While these are not CWE or CVE vulnerabilities, following best practices can help in preventing potential vulnerabilities or errors in the code.
