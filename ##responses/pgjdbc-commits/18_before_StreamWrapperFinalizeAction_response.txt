Based on the provided code, there don't appear to be any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. However, there are a few improvements that could be made:

1. Resource Leak:
The `close()` method should be invoked even if an exception occurs while closing the `InputStream` in the `getStream()` method. To ensure this happens, it is recommended to use a try-finally block to ensure that the resources are always closed, like this:

```java
public InputStream getStream() throws IOException {
  InputStream stream = this.stream;
  if (stream == null) {
    try {
      stream = Files.newInputStream(castNonNull(tempFile));
      this.stream = stream;
    } catch (IOException e) {
      if (stream != null) {
        stream.close();
      }
      throw e;
    }
  }
  return stream;
}
```

2. Potential NPE:
In the `close()` method, there is a possibility of a `NullPointerException` if the `tempFile` is `null` but the `stream` is not `null`. To avoid this, you can swap the order of closing the `tempFile` and the `stream` and check for `null` before closing, like this:

```java
@Override
public void close() throws IOException {
  InputStream stream = this.stream;
  if (stream != null) {
    stream.close();
    this.stream = null;
  }
  
  Path tempFile = this.tempFile;
  if (tempFile != null) {
    tempFile.toFile().delete();
    this.tempFile = null;
  }
}
```

These changes address potential issues but do not introduce any CWE or CVE vulnerabilities themselves.
