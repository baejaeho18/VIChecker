The provided code does not contain any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, I would like to point out a potential improvement in terms of exception handling in the last test method `testCloseOnCompletionExecuteTwice`.

Instead of relying on the specific error message in the `catch` block, it would be better to use `fail()` method from JUnit to indicate that the test has failed. This would ensure that any future changes in the error message do not cause the test to pass erroneously. Here is the modified version of the method:

```java
@Test
public void testCloseOnCompletionExecuteTwice() throws SQLException {
  PreparedStatement s = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT 1");

  s.closeOnCompletion();
  s.executeQuery();
  try {
    s.executeQuery();
    fail("Expected SQLException to be thrown");
  } catch (SQLException ex) {
    // Do nothing
  }
}
```

This modification ensures that the test fails if the second call to `executeQuery()` does not throw an exception.
