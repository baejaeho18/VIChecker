There doesn't appear to be any explicit CWE or CVE-related vulnerabilities in the provided code. However, it's important to note that the use of `@Nullable` in the code could potentially introduce nullability issues if not properly handled.

Additionally, without seeing the implementation of the `PGReplicationStream` interface, it's difficult to determine if there are any vulnerabilities present. It's always important to thoroughly review the implementation of any code to identify potential security issues.
