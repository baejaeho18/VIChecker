There are no CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities present in the given code.

However, there are a few things that could be improved in terms of code quality and best practices:

1. The code is missing proper error handling and logging for the `closeStream` method. It is currently empty, which means any IOException thrown while closing the stream will be ignored.

2. The use of `@Nullable` annotation in the `closeStream` method suggests the possibility of a null value being passed for the `newStream` parameter. It would be better to either handle the null case explicitly or remove the annotation if null is not expected.

3. The code could benefit from more descriptive variable names. For example, `protoName` could be named as `protocolVersion` to improve readability.

4. It's recommended to use `try-with-resources` statement for properly closing resources like the `PGStream` in the `closeStream` method to ensure that the resource is closed even in case of an exception.

Overall, the code is simple and does not seem to have any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities, but there are some areas that could be improved for better code quality.
