The code provided does not contain any obvious CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are a couple of potential areas that could be improved:

1. Error Handling in Static Initialization Block:
   In the static initialization block (marked with `static {}`), an `IllegalAccessException` caught and silently ignored. It is advisable to handle this exception properly by logging or notifying the appropriate parties so that any issues with the reflection process can be properly addressed.

2. Incomplete Exception Handling in valueOf() Method:
   In the `valueOf()` method, the code catches a `NumberFormatException` but does not handle it or provide any meaningful feedback to the caller. It is recommended to log or notify the appropriate parties when an invalid oid value is provided.

Although not necessarily a vulnerability, it is worth mentioning that using hardcoded OID values may pose maintainability issues in case the PostgreSQL database schema is updated. It would be better to retrieve these OID values dynamically from the PostgreSQL system catalog.

In terms of CWEs and CVEs, no specific numbers can be identified as there are no direct code vulnerabilities present.
