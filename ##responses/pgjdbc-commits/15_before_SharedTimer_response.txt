Based on the provided code, I did not identify any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. The code appears to be secure and does not contain any known vulnerabilities.

However, it is essential to keep in mind that vulnerabilities can exist in the code's context or usage. The code itself may be safe, but if it is used incorrectly or in an insecure environment, vulnerabilities can arise. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the code's overall deployment and usage to ensure security.
