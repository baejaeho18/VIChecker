The code provided does not contain any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities.

However, there are a few potential code smells or best practice violations that could be addressed:

1. The code seems to be missing import statements for the required classes. These import statements should be included at the top of the file.

2. The use of `assertTrue(rs.next())` without any further checks or assertions could be improved. It would be more informative to include specific assertions on the expected values of the columns in the result set.

3. The exception handling in both test methods could be enhanced. Instead of catching the `SQLException` and throwing a `RuntimeException`, it would be more appropriate to use an assertion method from the testing framework to verify the expected exception message or error code.

4. It is not clear why the `refreshRow()` method is being tested in these scenarios. It would be useful to add comments or documentation explaining the purpose of these tests and why refreshing the row is important in these cases.

While these issues are not security vulnerabilities, addressing them can improve code readability, maintainability, and robustness.
