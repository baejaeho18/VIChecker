There are no specific CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities in the given code snippet. However, there are a few general security best practices that can be applied to improve the code:

1. Input Validation: The code does not perform any input validation for user-supplied data. It is important to validate and sanitize inputs to prevent attacks such as SQL injection. This can be done by using prepared statements or input validation techniques.

2. Error Handling: The code does not handle exceptions or errors in a comprehensive manner. Proper error handling should be implemented to handle exceptions gracefully and prevent sensitive information from being exposed.

3. Secure Coding Practices: The code could benefit from incorporating secure coding practices such as avoiding the use of deprecated methods, properly closing connections, and using secure hash algorithms for password storage.

4. Data Encryption: The code does not address data encryption for sensitive information. It is advisable to incorporate encryption mechanisms to protect data at rest and in transit.

5. Authentication and Authorization: The code does not address authentication and authorization mechanisms. Access control mechanisms should be implemented to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data or perform certain actions.

Please note that these suggestions are general security best practices and not specific to CWE or CVE vulnerabilities identified in the code.
