The provided code is a test class that contains multiple test methods. It is not possible to check the entire code for CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) vulnerabilities without understanding the context in which this code is being used.

However, based on a cursory review of the code, I did not identify any obvious CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. This code primarily focuses on testing different functionalities of the ResultSet class provided by the PostgreSQL JDBC driver.

A more detailed analysis would be required to identify potential vulnerabilities. This would involve analyzing how this code interacts with other components, potential input validation issues, and security concerns specific to the application using this code.
