The code provided does not contain any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are some areas where improvements can be made to enhance the security and robustness of the code:

1. Input Validation:
   - The code should validate and sanitize user input, especially in the `addStringWithSize()` method, to prevent SQL injection attacks.
   - Use parameterized queries instead of concatenating strings to create SQL statements to avoid SQL injection vulnerabilities.

2. Error Handling:
   - Error handling is not explicitly shown in the code. Proper error handling should be implemented to gracefully handle exceptions and prevent information leakage.

3. Secure Communication:
   - It is important to ensure that secure communication channels (e.g., SSL/TLS) are used when connecting to the PostgreSQL database to protect sensitive data.

4. Authentication and Access Control:
   - The code does not include any authentication or access control mechanisms. It is important to implement proper authentication and access control measures to restrict unauthorized access.

5. Secure Configuration Management:
   - The code includes the use of properties for configuring the PostgreSQL connection. It is important to ensure that these configuration properties are properly managed and stored securely.

While the code itself does not contain any immediate CWE or CVE vulnerabilities, it is important to consider these broader security considerations when implementing an application.
