Based on the provided code, I couldn't find any specific Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) related vulnerability. The code mainly consists of property definitions for PostgreSQL database connections. However, it's worth noting that the absence of CWE or CVE vulnerabilities in this code may not guarantee that the application is completely secure. Vulnerabilities could be present in other parts of the application or dependent libraries. Additionally, it is important to keep the code up to date with the latest security patches and follow secure coding practices to minimize the risk of vulnerabilities.
