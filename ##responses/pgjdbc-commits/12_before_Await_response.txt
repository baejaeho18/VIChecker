The provided code does not have any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. 

The code is a utility class that provides a method `until` for waiting until a certain condition is met. It uses a timeout mechanism and checks the condition repeatedly until it is satisfied or until the timeout expires. If the timeout expires without the condition being met, an `AssertionError` is thrown.

Overall, the code follows standard best practices for implementing a timeout mechanism and does not contain any known security vulnerabilities.
