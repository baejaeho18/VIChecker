The code provided is a Java code that defines an enum PGProperty with multiple properties related to PostgreSQL database connection configuration. It does not contain any explicit CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) vulnerabilities.

However, it's important to note that the vulnerabilities related to CWE or CVE are dependent on how the code is used and implemented in the application. The presence of these vulnerabilities cannot be determined solely by looking at the code provided. It requires a comprehensive analysis of the entire application's architecture, implementation, and usage.

To ensure the code's security, it's recommended to follow secure coding practices, such as input validation, properly handling sensitive data, protecting against SQL injection, secure password management, and using authenticated and encrypted connections.
