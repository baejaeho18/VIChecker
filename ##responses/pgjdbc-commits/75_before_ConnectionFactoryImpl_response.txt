There are some potential CWE and CVE related vulnerabilities in the given code:

1. CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command (SQL Injection):
   There is a potential vulnerability for SQL injection in the `sendStartupPacket` method. The method constructs and sends a startup packet directly from the `params` list without properly sanitizing or validating the input values. An attacker can manipulate these parameters to inject malicious SQL commands into the startup packet, which can lead to unauthorized access or data manipulation.

2. CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer:
   In the `enableSSL` and `enableGSSEncrypted` methods, there are instances where the code receives a message length from the server (`msgLen`) and performs operations on received data without proper bounds checking. This can potentially lead to buffer overflows or other memory corruption vulnerabilities if the length is incorrect or manipulated by an attacker.

It's important to note that CWE and CVE identifiers are specific to known vulnerability types, and the analysis above is based on potential vulnerabilities that can be present in the code. To confirm the actual existence and severity of these vulnerabilities, a thorough code review and testing should be conducted.
