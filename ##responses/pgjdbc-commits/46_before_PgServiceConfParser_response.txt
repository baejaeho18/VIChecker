The code you provided does not contain any clear CWE or CVE vulnerabilities. However, I can suggest a few potential improvements to enhance security:

1. Input Validation: The code should validate the input provided to the `getServiceProperties` method and ensure that it meets the expected criteria to prevent any potential misuse or attacks.

2. Hardcoded Credentials: Make sure that there are no hardcoded credentials included in the code. Hardcoded credentials are a common source of vulnerabilities and should always be avoided. Instead, consider using a secure configuration mechanism or externalize the credentials.

3. Error Handling: The code currently logs error messages but does not handle them in a way that prevents any potential leakage of sensitive information. Ensure that error messages are appropriately handled and do not reveal sensitive details that could aid an attacker.

While these suggestions improve security, they are not related to specific CWE or CVE identifiers, as the code does not contain any known vulnerabilities based on those identifiers. It is always recommended to perform a thorough security review and testing of the code to identify any potential vulnerabilities specific to the application's context.
