The provided code is a Java code that defines an enum called `PGProperty`. It contains a list of properties with their names, default values, descriptions, and other attributes.

There don't appear to be any obvious CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities in the code itself. However, the presence of vulnerabilities highly depends on how the properties are used and the context in which they are used.

To identify potential vulnerabilities, you would need to assess how these properties are used in the larger codebase and consider any security implications that may arise from their usage. For example, if properties related to authentication or encryption are not properly handled, it could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.

It's recommended to review the codebase that uses these properties and perform a security assessment to identify any potential CWE or CVE vulnerabilities specific to the usage of these properties.
