There don't appear to be any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities in the provided code.

The code defines a set of constants representing various OIDs (Object IDs) in a PostgreSQL database. There are no obvious security vulnerabilities introduced by this code. The code is simply assigning integer values to constant variables and populating two `HashMap` objects to map OIDs to their corresponding names and vice versa. The `toString` and `valueOf` methods are provided for converting between OIDs and their names.

Overall, the code seems to be written correctly and does not exhibit any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities.
