There do not appear to be any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code. The code is simply a test class that is using JUnit to run a test case.

However, it's worth noting that the code is using the PostgreSQL JDBC driver to interact with a PostgreSQL database. If there are any known vulnerabilities in the version of the PostgreSQL JDBC driver being used, those would be related to the PostgreSQL project rather than the code shown here. It's always recommended to keep your dependencies up to date to avoid any known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
