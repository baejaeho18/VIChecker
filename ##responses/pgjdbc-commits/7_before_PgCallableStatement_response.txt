Potential CWE or CVE vulnerabilities in the provided code:

1. CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt: The code does not provide any evidence of using a one-way hash function with a salt to protect sensitive information such as passwords.

2. CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition: There are no explicit write operations in the provided code, so the risk of this vulnerability is low.

3. CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference: There is a possibility of null pointer dereference in the methods `wasNull()` and `getCallResult()` if the corresponding variables `lastIndex` or `callResult` are not properly initialized.

4. CWE-200: Information Exposure: The code does not appear to have any direct information exposure vulnerabilities. However, further analysis would be required to determine if any sensitive information is being handled or transmitted insecurely.

5. CWE-840: Incorrect Handling of Non-Boolean Comparison for Boolean Variable: There is a possibility of incorrect handling of boolean values in the method `getBoolean()`. While the method checks if the result is null before returning a boolean value, the actual conversion of the object to boolean might not be correct.

Note: The vulnerabilities mentioned above are potential risks, and a comprehensive analysis of the entire application and its context is required to accurately identify all vulnerabilities.
