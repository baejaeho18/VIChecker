The code does not contain any immediate CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, it is essential to note that without knowing the implementations of the classes imported (e.g., org.postgresql.PGProperty, org.postgresql.util.GT, org.postgresql.util.HostSpec, org.postgresql.util.PSQLException, org.postgresql.util.PSQLState), it is challenging to assess the security of the code fully.

It is crucial to regularly update the dependencies of this code and review any potential security vulnerabilities associated with the imported classes. Additionally, performing thorough input validation and considering potential SQL injection vulnerabilities is necessary when using input values (e.g., protoName) within queries.
