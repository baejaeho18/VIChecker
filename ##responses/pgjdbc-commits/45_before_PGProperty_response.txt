There do not appear to be any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code. The code defines an enumeration of properties for a PostgreSQL database connection and provides methods for getting and setting these properties. The properties are used to configure the behavior of the database connection. The code is well-structured and appears to handle any potential exceptions or errors gracefully. However, without the full context of how these properties are used and validated, it is difficult to definitively determine if there are any security vulnerabilities in the code.
