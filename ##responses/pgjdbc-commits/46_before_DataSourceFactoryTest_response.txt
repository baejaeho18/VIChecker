There doesn't appear to be any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the code provided. However, here are a few general security considerations:

1. Code Injection: The usage of dynamic SQL queries in the `testConnection` method (`st.executeQuery("select 2+2*2")`) could potentially be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. It is recommended to use parameterized queries or prepared statements to mitigate this risk.

2. Input Validation: The `loadPropertyFiles` method loads properties files based on user-supplied names. It is important to validate and sanitize these names to prevent directory traversal attacks or reading sensitive files.

3. Error Handling: The catch block in the `loadPropertyFiles` method is empty, which could lead to any exceptions being silently ignored. It is recommended to handle exceptions appropriately and provide meaningful error messages or logging.

4. Access Control: The code is accessing resources such as files and database connections using system-level permissions. It is ideal to implement appropriate access control measures to ensure that only authorized users or processes can access these resources.

It's always important to review the code in the context of the entire system and its intended use to identify any potential vulnerabilities.
