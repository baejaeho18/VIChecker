The code provided is the source code of the "PgPreparedStatement" class. Without the context of the entire codebase, it is not possible to determine if there are any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. CWEs and CVEs are typically assigned to specific vulnerabilities identified in software, but this information cannot be determined from the provided code alone. Additionally, without the full codebase and its dependencies, it is not possible to identify any potential vulnerabilities. It is recommended to analyze and test the entire codebase, including any dependencies, using security analysis tools to identify and mitigate any vulnerabilities.
