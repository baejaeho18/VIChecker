In the given code, there are no specific CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities that can be identified. However, it is important to note that the code is using dynamic SQL queries directly built from user input, which can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if not handled properly. It is recommended to use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of concatenating user input to construct SQL queries.
