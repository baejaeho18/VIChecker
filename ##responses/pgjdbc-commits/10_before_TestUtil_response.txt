The following code appears to be a Java class that contains various utility methods for working with a PostgreSQL database. While it does not contain any obvious CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities, there are some potential issues that may arise in certain scenarios:

1. SQL Injection: The code constructs SQL queries using string concatenation, which is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks if the input values are not properly sanitized. To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should use parameterized queries or prepared statements.

2. Resource Leakage: There are several places in the code where resources such as connections, statements, and result sets are used but not always properly closed. This can lead to resource leakage and potential denial-of-service vulnerabilities. All resources should be closed using the appropriate try-with-resources or finally blocks to ensure timely release of resources.

3. Password Handling: The code retrieves passwords from system properties, which may not be a secure method for handling sensitive information. It is recommended to use a more secure method, such as storing passwords in a secure location or using encryption, to protect sensitive information.

4. Error Handling: The code catches exceptions but does not provide meaningful error messages or handle exceptions in a robust manner. This can lead to information leakage and makes it difficult to troubleshoot issues. Proper error handling and logging should be implemented to provide better error messages and handle exceptions gracefully.

While the code does not have any specific CWE or CVE numbers associated with vulnerabilities, it is important to consider these potential issues and ensure proper security practices are followed when using this code in production systems.
