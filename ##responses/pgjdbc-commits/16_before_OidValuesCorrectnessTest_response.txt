The code provided does not contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. It is a unit test class for validating the correctness of OID (Object Identifier) values in a PostgreSQL database.

The code retrieves a list of OID names and corresponding values from the `Oid` class using reflection. It then iterates over these values and performs a database query to check if the OID value exists for each OID name. This ensures that the OID values in the database match the expected values defined in the code.

The code includes parameterized tests that use different OID names and values for testing. It also includes some conditional logic to ignore certain OID names, specify minimum server versions for specific OID names, and map OID names to their corresponding type names.

Overall, the code appears to be secure and does not contain any known CWE or CVE vulnerabilities.
