Based on the given code, there doesn't appear to be any explicit CWE or CVE-related vulnerabilities. However, there are a few potential areas of concern that should be addressed:

1) CWE-119: Failure to Handle Exceptional Conditions - In both `getSocketFactory()` and `getSslSocketFactory()`, there are potential exceptions that could occur during the instantiation of the socket or SSL socket factory. These exceptions are caught, but the error handling is limited to throwing a `PSQLException` with a generic error message. It is recommended to log or handle these exceptions more effectively to provide better information to developers and users.

2) CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') - The code does not appear to handle any URL redirection or user-controlled input that may lead to an open redirect vulnerability. However, without the full context and the implementation of the `ObjectFactory` class, it is difficult to definitively determine if there are any potential open redirect vulnerabilities. It is important to ensure that all user-controlled input is properly validated and sanitized.

Overall, these concerns are not directly related to CWE or CVE vulnerabilities but rather good programming practices and defensive programming techniques.
