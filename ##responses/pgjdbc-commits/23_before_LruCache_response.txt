The code you provided appears to be a custom implementation of an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache. After reviewing the code, I did not find any specific CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities.

However, there are a few potential issues that could be considered best practices or potential vulnerabilities depending on the context in which this code is used:

1. No Input Validation: The code does not perform any input validation on the `maxSizeEntries` and `maxSizeBytes` parameters. It is important to ensure that these values are validated and constrained to prevent potential abuse or denial of service attacks.

2. SQLException Handling: The code catches `SQLException` when evicting a value but does not log or handle the exception in any way. Depending on the requirements and context, this may need to be addressed to ensure proper error handling and logging.

3. Lack of Thread Safety: The code does not include any explicit synchronization or locking mechanisms to handle concurrent access to the cache. Depending on the usage scenario, this may need to be addressed to ensure thread safety.

4. No Memory Size Constraint: While the code keeps track of the currentSize of the cache, there is no mechanism in place to prevent the cache from growing indefinitely. Without proper constraints, the cache could consume excessive memory and potentially lead to out-of-memory errors.

It is important to consider the context and requirements of your specific application when evaluating the potential vulnerabilities in this code.
