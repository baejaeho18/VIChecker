The provided code does not contain any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. 

However, there are a few improvements that can be made for best practices:

1. The package name "org.postgresql.jdbc" suggests that the code is related to the PostgreSQL JDBC driver. It is not recommended to modify or extend classes in external libraries directly. Instead, it is better to use the available APIs provided by the library.

2. The "obtain" method is not necessary in this case. Since the class already extends ReentrantLock, the lock() method can be directly called on the instance of ResourceLock.

3. The close() method should be called within a try-finally block to ensure that the lock is always released, even in case of an exception.

Here is an updated version of the code with the mentioned improvements:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public final class ResourceLock implements AutoCloseable {
  private ReentrantLock lock;

  public ResourceLock() {
    lock = new ReentrantLock();
  }

  public void acquire() {
    lock.lock();
  }

  @Override
  public void close() {
    lock.unlock();
  }
}
```

Note: This updated code does not introduce any CWE or CVE vulnerabilities.
