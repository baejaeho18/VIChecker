Based on the given code, I didn't find any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, it is important to note that vulnerabilities can exist not only in the code but also in the libraries and dependencies used by the code. It is a good practice to regularly update the libraries and dependencies to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched.
