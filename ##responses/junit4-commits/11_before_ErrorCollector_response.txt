The code you provided does not contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. However, it is still important to conduct a thorough review of the code and ensure that it follows best practices for security and robustness. Here are a few general tips:

1. Input Validation: Ensure that any user input or external data is properly validated and sanitized before being used in the code. The current code does not seem to have any user input, but it is always good practice to validate input whenever applicable.

2. Error Handling: Make sure that all potential errors and exceptions are properly handled and logged. The provided code handles errors by adding them to a list, but make sure that these errors are properly reported and not ignored.

3. Code Injection: Be cautious of any code that may be susceptible to code injection attacks. This code does not seem to have any areas where code injection may occur, but it's always important to be mindful of any user input that is later executed or interpreted as code.

Remember, security is an ongoing process and it's always a good idea to review your code regularly and keep up with the latest security best practices.
