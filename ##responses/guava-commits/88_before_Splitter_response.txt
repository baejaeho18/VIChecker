The code appears to be implementing a Splitter class, which is used for splitting strings into substrings based on a specified separator. After reviewing the code, I did not find any specific CWE or CVE vulnerabilities. However, there are some general coding best practices that could be improved:

1. In the method `public static Splitter on(final String separator)`, there is a potential for a NullPointerException if `separator` is null. It would be better to use `Objects.requireNonNull(separator)` instead of `checkArgument(separator.length() != 0, "The separator may not be the empty string.")` to handle null values.

2. The usage of the `AbstractIterator` class is deprecated. It would be better to use the newer `Iterator` interface provided by Java.

These are just general recommendations to improve the code quality, but I did not find any specific security vulnerabilities in the code.
