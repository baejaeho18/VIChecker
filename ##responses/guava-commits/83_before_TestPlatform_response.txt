Based on the provided code, there are no apparent CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities.

The code is a simple Java class with two static methods. The first method, `intsCanGoOutOfRange()`, returns a boolean value of `false`. This method does not involve any potential vulnerabilities.

The second method, `isAndroid()`, checks if the system property "java.runtime.name" contains the string "Android". This method is used to determine if the code is running on an Android platform. While this method itself does not appear to have any vulnerabilities, it relies on the accuracy of the system property "java.runtime.name". If this property is manipulated or spoofed, the method result may not accurately reflect the platform. However, this would not be considered a CWE or CVE vulnerability in the code itself.

Overall, based on the provided code snippet, there are no evident CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, the security of the code in a real-world scenario may depend on the context in which it is used.
