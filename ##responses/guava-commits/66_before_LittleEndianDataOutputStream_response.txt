Based on the provided code, I couldn't find any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a simple implementation of a Little Endian Data Output Stream, which writes data in little-endian format.

However, it's essential to note that this analysis is based on the code snippet provided and does not take into account the usage or integration of this code in a larger system context. The presence of vulnerabilities in software depends on how the code is used, its interaction with other components, and the specific threats and security requirements of the system.
