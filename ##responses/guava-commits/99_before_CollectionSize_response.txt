There don't appear to be any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code. The code is generally well-structured and follows best practices for enums and annotations. However, without the complete context of how this code is being used or any dependencies it has, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive analysis. It's always a good idea to have a thorough review and testing process in place for any code before deploying it to production.
