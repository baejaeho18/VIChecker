The code provided does not contain any explicit CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, without the full context and dependencies, it is difficult to assess if there are any potential vulnerabilities. It is always recommended to review the code within the context of the entire application and consider additional factors such as input validation, data sanitization, access control, and secure coding practices to fully ensure the absence of vulnerabilities.
