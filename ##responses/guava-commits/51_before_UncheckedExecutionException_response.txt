The code you provided does not contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities.

However, one potential issue related to security is the use of a public constructor for `UncheckedExecutionException`. This allows anyone to create instances of this exception, which might lead to potential misuse or confusion. It would be better to provide only specific constructors with necessary argument validations, and enforce controlled creation of instances.
