There are no specific CWE or CVE numbers associated with the code you provided. However, here are some potential issues that could be considered:

1. Information Disclosure: The code contains several assert methods that include the object being tested in the failure message. This could potentially expose sensitive information if the failure message is logged or displayed to users. Depending on the context in which this code is used, it may be necessary to remove or sanitize the failure messages.

2. Input Validation: The code does not perform any input validation on the arguments passed to the various utility methods. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities if invalid or malicious input is provided. It is recommended to add appropriate input validation to ensure that the code functions as expected and does not expose any security vulnerabilities.

3. Insecure Deserialization: The code defines a custom implementation of the Serializable interface in the `NullsBefore` class. This could potentially introduce a security vulnerability if the serialized objects are deserialized in an insecure manner. It is important to ensure that proper deserialization practices are followed to prevent any potential exploitation of deserialization vulnerabilities.

It is important to note that these are general observations and the significance of these issues may vary depending on the specific use case and implementation context of the code. A comprehensive security assessment and code review should be conducted to identify and address any specific vulnerabilities.
