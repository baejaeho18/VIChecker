There are no specific CWE or CVE vulnerabilities in the provided code. However, there are a few potential code quality issues that can be improved:

1. Missing documentation: The code should have appropriate comments and Javadoc annotations to describe what each method does and any potential inputs, outputs, or side effects.

2. Error handling: The code uses a try-catch block to handle exceptions, but it would be more helpful to log or handle the exceptions appropriately rather than simply rethrowing them.

3. Input validation: While the code checks for null inputs in some places, it does not perform thorough input validation in all methods. It would be good practice to validate inputs and throw appropriate exceptions or handle invalid inputs gracefully.

4. Code duplication: There is some duplicated code for opening a stream and handling resources in both the `writeLines` and `writeFrom` methods. Consider refactoring this into a helper method to avoid redundancy.

Overall, the code appears to be reasonably secure. However, ensuring proper error handling, input validation, and code organization can help improve code quality and reduce potential vulnerabilities.
