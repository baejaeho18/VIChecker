The code you provided does not contain any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a collection of utility methods for creating various types of collections and arrays. It does not perform any input handling, data processing, or interaction with external systems that could introduce vulnerabilities.

However, without the context of how this code is being used and integrated into a larger system, it is not possible to definitively determine if there are any vulnerabilities. CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) and CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) are typically associated with specific vulnerabilities that can arise from specific code patterns, configurations, or implementation details. Without such details, it is not possible to identify CWEs or CVEs in this code snippet.
