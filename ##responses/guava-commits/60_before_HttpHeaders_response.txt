The provided code does not contain any CWE or CVE-related vulnerabilities. It is a class that provides constant strings for various HTTP headers. These constants are used to ensure consistency and reduce the chance of typos or mistakes when using these headers in code.

However, it is worth noting that the class does not implement any header validation or sanitization logic. It is assumed that the headers will be used correctly and safely in the calling code. If the headers are derived from user input or untrusted sources, it is important to validate and sanitize them before using them to prevent vulnerabilities such as injection attacks.

Additionally, it is good practice to keep the dependencies of a project up-to-date to mitigate any potential vulnerabilities in the underlying libraries used.
