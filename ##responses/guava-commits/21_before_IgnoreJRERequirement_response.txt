The provided code does not contain any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. 

However, there are a few issues with the code:

1. The import statement `import static java.lang.annotation.ElementType.CONSTRUCTOR;` is unnecessary as it duplicates the import statement `import static java.lang.annotation.ElementType.METHOD;` and `import static java.lang.annotation.ElementType.TYPE;`. You can remove this line.

2. The annotation `@ElementTypesAreNonnullByDefault` is missing its definition in the code you provided. The annotation is not a part of the standard Java library, so you might be missing a library or class that contains the definition for this annotation.
