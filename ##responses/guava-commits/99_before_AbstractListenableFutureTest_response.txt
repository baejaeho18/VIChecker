Based on the code provided, I didn't identify any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. The code seems to be focused on testing the functionality of `ListenableFuture`. However, it's worth noting that without the implementation of the `createListenableFuture` method, it's not possible to determine if there are any vulnerabilities related to its implementation.

To ensure that the code is secure, it's important to review the implementation of the `createListenableFuture` method and verify that it handles exceptions properly, sanitizes inputs, and doesn't introduce any security vulnerabilities.
