Based on the code you provided, there are no clear CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities present. However, it is worth noting that the code snippet itself is incomplete and doesn't provide enough context to fully assess the security of the entire application. CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) and CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) are typically assigned to specific vulnerabilities found in software.

To determine if there are any CWE or CVE vulnerabilities within a codebase, it is recommended to perform a thorough code review and security testing using tools such as static analysis tools, dynamic scanning, and penetration testing. These measures will help identify any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the code.
