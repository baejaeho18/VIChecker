There are no CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code.

CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) is a list of software weaknesses and vulnerabilities. CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is a list of publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities and exposures.

The code you provided is a class definition for the AbstractContainerTester class, and it does not contain any code that is vulnerable to known CWEs or CVEs. However, the code does have some annotations and imports that are not directly related to security vulnerabilities, such as the GwtCompatible annotation and the com.google.errorprone.annotations package. These are specific to the Google Guava library and may not have any direct security implications.

To determine if there are any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the code, it would be necessary to analyze the implementation of the methods in the superclass (AbstractTester) and any classes that extend this abstract class.
