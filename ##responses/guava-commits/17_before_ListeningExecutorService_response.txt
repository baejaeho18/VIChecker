The provided code does not contain any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities.

CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) and CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) are identifiers for known security vulnerabilities in software. To determine if a code snippet contains these vulnerabilities, one needs to analyze the code for specific patterns or logic flaws that could lead to security weaknesses.

In the provided code, there are no obvious security issues such as untrusted input handling, insecure data storage, or vulnerable cryptographic implementations. However, without further context or details about the application's requirements and usage, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive security assessment.
