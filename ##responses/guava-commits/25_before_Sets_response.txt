The code does not contain any obvious CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, it is important to note that without the full context of how this code is used, it is difficult to determine if there are any specific vulnerabilities. CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) and CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) are catalogues of known software vulnerabilities, and in order to identify specific vulnerabilities in the code, a thorough analysis of the code and its usage in the larger system would be required.
