The provided code is missing any actual code implementation, so it is not possible to analyze it for CWE or CVE vulnerabilities. CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) and CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) are specific vulnerabilities that can occur in software due to flaws in design, implementation, or configuration. Without any code, it is not possible to identify any vulnerabilities in the specific implementation itself.
