The code snippet you provided does not contain any specific functionality or vulnerability. It only includes some package-level annotations from the Google Guava library.

However, it's important to note that CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) and CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) are typically associated with specific vulnerabilities found in software components or libraries. Without the actual code or functionality that implements some logic or processing, it is not possible to identify specific CWE or CVE numbers for vulnerabilities.
