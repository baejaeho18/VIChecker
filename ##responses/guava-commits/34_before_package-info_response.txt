The provided code does not contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. 

CWEs and CVEs are specific vulnerabilities that can be introduced through coding errors or flaws in software systems. However, in this particular code snippet, there are no identifiable vulnerabilities.

The code includes annotations such as `@CheckReturnValue` and `@ParametersAreNonnullByDefault`, which are used for code quality and to enhance static analysis. These annotations do not introduce any vulnerabilities on their own.

Without access to the implementation details of the package, it is not possible to identify any specific vulnerabilities directly in this code snippet. To ensure the security of a software system, it is important to perform a thorough code review and application-level security testing of the entire application, including dependencies and external libraries.
