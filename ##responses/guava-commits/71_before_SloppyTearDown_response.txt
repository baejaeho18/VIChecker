Based on the provided code, I do not see any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. The code is relatively simple and does not contain any obvious security flaws.

However, it is worth noting that the code is incomplete and some imported classes and annotations are missing. Without seeing the complete code and its context, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive analysis.
