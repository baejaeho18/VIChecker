The code you provided is an interface definition and does not contain any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) and CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) are classifications for software vulnerabilities and exposures, and they are typically associated with specific code implementations or security issues. 

However, it is important to note that vulnerabilities can arise from the implementation of this interface or how it is used in the codebase. It's always a good practice to review the code that implements this interface to ensure that it is used correctly and securely to avoid potential vulnerabilities.
