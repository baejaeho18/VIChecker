The code you provided does not contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. However, there are a few points to note about the code:

1. Error Handling: The code does not handle exceptions in a robust manner. For example, in the `getObjectParser()` method, if the tag class is not CONTEXT_SPECIFIC, an `ASN1Exception` is thrown. However, catching this exception and handling it appropriately would be more robust.

2. Naming Conventions: The code does not follow standard Java naming conventions. For example, variable names should start with a lowercase letter and use camel case. Consider renaming `_tagClass` to `tagClass`, `_tagNo` to `tagNo`, and `_parser` to `parser`.

3. Code Duplication: The `parseImplicitBaseTagged()` method and the `parseExplicitBaseTagged()` method both create a new `BERTaggedObjectParser` object. Consider refactoring the code to avoid duplication by extracting the common logic into a separate method.

While these issues do not introduce vulnerabilities in the code, addressing them can improve code quality and maintainability.
