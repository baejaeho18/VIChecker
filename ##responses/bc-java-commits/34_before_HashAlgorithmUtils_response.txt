Based on the provided code, there are no CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. The code is a simple switch statement that maps hash algorithm IDs to their corresponding names as strings. It does not involve any user input, file handling, or network interactions that could introduce vulnerabilities.

However, it's important to note that the code provided is a small subset of a larger project. Therefore, there might be other potential vulnerabilities present in the rest of the codebase, but they cannot be determined with the given information. It is always recommended to perform a thorough code review and testing to identify and mitigate any vulnerabilities.
