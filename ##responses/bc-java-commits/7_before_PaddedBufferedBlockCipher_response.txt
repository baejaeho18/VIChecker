The provided code does not contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. However, it's important to note that vulnerability assessment is not solely dependent on the code itself. The security of a system also depends on the context in which the code is used, the environment, and the overall architecture. It's recommended to conduct a comprehensive security assessment that covers all aspects of the system to ensure its security.
