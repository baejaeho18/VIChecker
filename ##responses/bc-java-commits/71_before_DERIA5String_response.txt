The code provided does not contain any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, it is important to note that vulnerabilities can exist not only in the code itself, but also in how it is used or integrated with other components. Therefore, a thorough security assessment should consider the context in which this code is being used.

That being said, it is recommended to follow secure coding practices in order to minimize the risk of introducing vulnerabilities. This includes input validation, secure coding libraries, and testing against known vulnerabilities. Additionally, keeping the code and its dependencies up to date with the latest security patches is crucial.
