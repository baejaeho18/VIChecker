The code you provided does not have any obvious CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are a few best practices that can be considered for improvement:

1. The use of GCM mode for encryption (as indicated by the use of `GCMParameterSpec`) is generally recommended. GCM provides both confidentiality and integrity protection. However, it is important to ensure that the parameters used for GCM, such as the nonce and the MAC length, are generated and handled securely.

2. It is important to properly validate and sanitize inputs, such as the `nonce` and `aad` parameters, before using them in cryptographic operations. Failure to validate inputs can lead to vulnerabilities such as injection attacks.

3. It is advisable to check for exceptions and handle them appropriately. The code currently throws `InvalidKeyException` and `InvalidAlgorithmParameterException`, but there is no explicit error handling or reporting. Proper error handling can help prevent potential issues and provide useful feedback for debugging.

While the code you provided does not exhibit any specific CWE or CVE vulnerabilities, it is important to review the surrounding code and context in which this class is used to ensure that it is implemented securely.
