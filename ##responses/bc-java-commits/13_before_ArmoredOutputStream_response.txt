I don't see any explicit CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code. However, here are a few potential security concerns that should be addressed:

1. Insecure Hash Algorithms: The method `beginClearText` allows the caller to specify the hash algorithm to be used. It is important to ensure that only secure hash algorithms are used, as weak hash algorithms can lead to vulnerabilities such as collision attacks. Ensure that the allowed hash algorithms are up-to-date and considered secure.

2. Insecure Encoding: The code uses a custom encoding table for Base64 encoding. It is recommended to use a widely-accepted and well-tested library for encoding and decoding operations, such as java.util.Base64.

3. Insecure Random Number Generation: The code does not include any secure random number generation for cryptographic operations. It is recommended to use a strong random number generator, such as java.security.SecureRandom, when generating cryptographic keys or nonces.

4. Unvalidated Input: The code does not perform any input validation or sanitization. Ensure that all user input or external input is properly validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks or other vulnerabilities.

5. Lack of Error Handling: The code does not handle potential exceptions or errors properly. It is recommended to include appropriate error handling and logging mechanisms to detect and respond to errors or system failures.

It's important to note that this analysis is based solely on the provided code snippet, and there may be other potential vulnerabilities outside the scope of this analysis.
