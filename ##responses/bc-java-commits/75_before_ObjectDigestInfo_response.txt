The provided code appears to be implementing the ObjectDigestInfo class in the Bouncy Castle library. After reviewing the code, I did not identify any specific CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. However, it's important to note that code vulnerabilities can exist based on context, usage, and other factors beyond the code itself.

To ensure the security and reliability of the code, it's recommended to adhere to secure coding practices, follow cryptographic guidelines, and regularly update the Bouncy Castle library to the latest versions, as they often include bug fixes and security patches. Additionally, appropriate input validation and error handling should be implemented when using this code in a real-world application.
