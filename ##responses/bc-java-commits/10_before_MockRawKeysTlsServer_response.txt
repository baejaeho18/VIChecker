There don't appear to be any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code. However, here are a few observations:

1. The use of "fullName" and "ca" fields in the method "loadSignerCredentials()" is not clear from the provided code, and it may lead to potential issues with certificate loading and validation.

2. The use of hardcoded file names ("x509-client-ed25519.pem" and "x509-client-key-ed25519.pem") in the method "getECDSASignerCredentials()" may pose a security risk if these files contain sensitive information and are accessible to unauthorized users.

3. The method "allowCertificateStatus()" disables certificate status checking for the case where the server certificate type is "RawPublicKey". This may weaken the security of the TLS connection if certificate status checking is required.

4. The method "allowMultiCertStatus()" disables multi-certificate status checking for the case where the server certificate type is "RawPublicKey". Similar to the previous point, this may weaken the security of the TLS connection if multi-certificate status checking is required.

Please note that these are general observations and additional context or code could provide more specific insights into potential vulnerabilities.
