There are no direct CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code. However, there are some areas where potential vulnerabilities could arise if the code is not used correctly or if the input is not properly validated.

1. In the method `getLoadedObject()`, there is a call to `_parser.loadTaggedDL()` without validation or sanitization of the input values. If the values passed to this method are not properly validated or sanitized, it could lead to potential vulnerabilities such as arbitrary code execution or denial of service. This vulnerability would be CWE-20: Improper Input Validation.

2. In the methods `parseBaseUniversal()` and `parseExplicitBaseObject()`, there is a check for `_constructed` before performing certain operations. If the value of `_constructed` is not properly validated or sanitized, it could lead to potential vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access or data leakage. This vulnerability would be CWE-284: Improper Access Control.

To mitigate these potential vulnerabilities, it is important to ensure that all input values are properly validated, sanitized, and restricted to trusted sources. Additionally, it is recommended to follow secure coding practices and guidelines specific to the language and framework being used.
