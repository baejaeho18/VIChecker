The provided code does not contain any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are a few areas that can be improved for better code quality:

1. Unused Imports: The code imports several classes that are not used. These unused imports should be removed to improve readability and avoid confusion.

2. Deprecated Methods: The code contains several deprecated methods such as `setHeader()`, `clearHeaders()`, `addHeader()`, and `resetHeaders()`. It is recommended to use their replacements or alternative methods to ensure future compatibility and avoid potential issues.

3. Error Handling: The code throws generic `IOException` in some cases without providing specific error messages or handling specific exceptions. It is best practice to use specific exception types and provide meaningful error messages for easier debugging and troubleshooting.

4. Code Formatting: The code should follow consistent code formatting style throughout, including indentation, curly brace placement, and spacing. This will improve readability and make the code easier to understand.

5. Code Documentation: The code lacks proper code documentation such as method descriptions, parameter details, and return value explanations. Adding appropriate comments and documentation will make the code more understandable and maintainable.

Overall, the code does not appear to have any significant security vulnerabilities, but there are areas for improvement in terms of code quality and best practices.
