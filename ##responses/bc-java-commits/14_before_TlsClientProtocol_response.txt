The code provided does not contain any obvious CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities based on a quick review. However, it is important to note that a more comprehensive code review should be conducted by a security specialist to identify potential vulnerabilities.

Some good practices to consider:

1. Ensure proper input validation and sanitization to prevent attacks like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
2. Implement appropriate access controls to protect sensitive data and resources.
3. Use secure coding practices, such as avoiding hardcoded passwords or encryption keys, and using secure cryptographic algorithms.
4. Implement proper error handling and logging to assist in identifying and addressing potential issues.
5. Stay updated on the latest security vulnerabilities and patches related to the libraries and frameworks used in your code.

Overall, it is important to perform regular security assessments and follow best practices to ensure the code is secure and protected against potential threats.
