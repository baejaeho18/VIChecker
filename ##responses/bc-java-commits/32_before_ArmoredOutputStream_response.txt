This code does not contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities.

However, I would like to mention some general best practices that could be applied to this code to improve its security:

1. Use secure hash algorithms: The code currently allows the use of MD5 and SHA1 hash algorithms, which are considered weak and vulnerable to attacks. It would be better to use stronger hash algorithms, such as SHA256 or SHA3, to ensure the integrity of the data.

2. Input validation and sanitization: The code does not perform any input validation or sanitization on the header values. It is important to validate and sanitize all user-supplied inputs to prevent injection attacks or other malicious activities.

3. Handle exceptions properly: The code throws IOException in several places but does not handle it properly. It is important to handle exceptions gracefully and provide appropriate error messages or handle the exceptions in a way that does not expose sensitive information.

4. Use a secure random number generator: The code does not explicitly use a secure random number generator. It is important to use a cryptographically secure random number generator for generating any random values or keys.

5. Secure coding practices: The code could benefit from implementing secure coding practices such as input validation, output encoding, and proper error handling to prevent common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, injection attacks, or information leakage.

It is also important to note that this code may have security vulnerabilities that are not related to CWE or CVE, as the presence or absence of a CWE or CVE identifier does not guarantee the security of the code. A thorough security assessment and code review should be conducted to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
