Based on the provided code, there doesn't seem to be any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are a few points to consider for improving code quality and security:

1. Error Handling: The `previous()` method currently throws an internal error using `DbException.getInternalError()`. It's recommended to handle exceptions gracefully and provide appropriate error messaging to the user.

2. Access Modifiers: The `MetaCursor` class and its constructor are currently package-private. Consider whether it should be accessible outside this package and adjust the access modifiers accordingly.

3. Injection Vulnerabilities: The code snippet itself doesn't contain any database or user input interactions. However, it's important to ensure proper handling of user input to prevent potential SQL injection or other injection vulnerabilities at the broader context where this class is used.

4. Input Validation: Although not explicitly shown in the provided code, ensure that any input received by the `MetaCursor` class is properly validated and sanitized to prevent unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

Remember that code security is a continuous process, and context is crucial. While the provided code snippet itself seems relatively safe, be vigilant in reviewing the broader system and its usage of this code to address any potential vulnerabilities.
