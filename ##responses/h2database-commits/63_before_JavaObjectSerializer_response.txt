The provided code is an interface definition. As an interface, it does not contain any actual code implementation, and therefore does not directly introduce any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) vulnerabilities.

However, it is important to note that the actual implementation of this interface could potentially introduce vulnerabilities if not properly implemented. CWEs and CVEs are specific to possible vulnerabilities in code, not interface definitions themselves.
