The code you provided does not contain any specific CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. However, there are a few general coding best practices that can be improved in the code:

1. Input validation: The code does not perform any input validation on the values passed to the methods. It is important to validate user inputs to prevent any potential vulnerabilities such as SQL injection. Make sure to validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in database queries.

2. Exception handling: The code uses a try-catch block but does not provide detailed error handling. It is important to handle exceptions properly and provide informative error messages to users, while avoiding leaking sensitive information.

3. Code readability and maintainability: The code can benefit from adding comments to describe the purpose and functionality of each method and variable. This will help other developers understand and maintain the code in the future.

4. Code refactoring: There are a few sections in the code that could be refactored to improve readability and maintainability. For example, the switch-case statement in the tryUpdate() method can be extracted into separate methods for each case to make the code more modular and easier to understand.

These suggestions are general best practices and are not specific vulnerabilities. To identify any specific CWE or CVE vulnerabilities, a security code review or static code analysis tool should be used.
