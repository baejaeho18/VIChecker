This code does not seem to have any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. However, without seeing the implementation of the parent class `SchemaObject` and other related classes, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive assessment.

To ensure the security of the code, you should consider the following best practices:

1. Input validation: Ensure that any user input, such as the `name` parameter in the `Constant` constructor, is properly validated to prevent potential input-based vulnerabilities like SQL injection.
2. Secure handling of sensitive data: If the `Value` object contains sensitive information, ensure that proper encryption and secure storage methods are used to protect it.
3. Access control: Make sure that only authorized users can access and modify the `Constant` objects by implementing appropriate access control mechanisms.
4. Error handling: Properly handle exceptions and errors to prevent potential information leakage or denial of service attacks.

It is recommended to perform a comprehensive security review and testing of the entire codebase to identify any potential vulnerabilities in other parts of the project.
