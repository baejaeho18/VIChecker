Based on the provided code, I couldn't find any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are some general recommendations to improve the code:

1. Input validation: The code should perform input validation and sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

2. Error handling: The code should handle and log exceptions properly. Currently, some exceptions are thrown but it's not clear how they are handled.

3. Secure coding practices: Ensure that sensitive data, such as database credentials, are properly protected and not exposed in the code.

4. Access control: Verify that the appropriate access controls are enforced when checking table rights and dropping tables.

5. Review dependencies: Review and update any external dependencies (such as libraries) used in the code to ensure they are up-to-date and free from known vulnerabilities.

Note: Without the complete context of the application and how this code is used, it's possible that there are additional vulnerabilities not evident from this code snippet. A thorough security review should be conducted on the entire application, including its architecture, configuration, and deployment.
