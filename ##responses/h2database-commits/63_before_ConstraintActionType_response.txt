The code you provided appears to be an enum class in Java, specifically, the `ConstraintActionType` class in the `org.h2.constraint` package. From the code, it does not seem to contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities.

The code defines four enumeration values: `RESTRICT`, `CASCADE`, `SET_DEFAULT`, and `SET_NULL`. It also includes a `getSqlName()` method that returns the SQL name corresponding to each enumeration value, translating `SET_DEFAULT` to `"SET DEFAULT"` and `SET_NULL` to `"SET NULL"`. The method uses an if-else structure to handle these specific cases.

Overall, the provided code is simple and does not exhibit any CWE or CVE vulnerabilities.
