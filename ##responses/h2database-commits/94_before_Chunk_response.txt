There are no specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code. However, here are a few observations:

1. It is good practice to add comments explaining the purpose of each method and class.
2. The class name "Chunk" could be more descriptive.
3. It is recommended to add input validation checks to ensure that the provided values are valid.
4. The code does not handle exceptions or errors gracefully. It would be beneficial to implement error handling and recovery mechanisms.
5. There are no security-related vulnerabilities present in the code, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or insecure cryptographic algorithms.

Overall, the code appears to be well-written and does not contain any evident CWE or CVE vulnerabilities. However, a thorough review of the entire codebase and its usage would be necessary to identify any potential security weaknesses.
