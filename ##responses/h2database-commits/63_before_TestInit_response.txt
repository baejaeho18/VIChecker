Based on the provided code, there doesn't appear to be any direct CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are a few best practices that can be followed to improve the code's security:

1. Input Validation: The code should verify and validate any user inputs before using them in SQL queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

2. Error Handling: Proper error handling should be implemented to handle any exceptions that may occur during database operations.

3. Resource Management: Closeable resources such as connections, statements, and result sets should be properly closed using try-with-resources or in a finally block to avoid resource leaks.

Overall, the code looks relatively safe. However, additional security measures should be implemented depending on the actual usage and the potential threats the code may face.
