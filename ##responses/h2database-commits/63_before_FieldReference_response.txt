Based on the provided code, there are a few potential vulnerabilities:

1. CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison (Operational Difference)
In the `optimize` method, there is a comparison using `type.getValueType() != Value.ROW`. CWE-697 identifies the issue when an incorrect type is used in a comparison, which could lead to logic bugs or vulnerabilities.

2. CWE-704: Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast
In the same `optimize` method, there is a potential issue when assigning `type = entry.getValue()`. If the value retrieved from `entry.getValue()` cannot be properly casted or converted to the expected type, it could result in unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

To mitigate these potential vulnerabilities, it is recommended to thoroughly validate and sanitize inputs, perform proper type checking and handling, and ensure secure coding practices are followed.
