The code you provided does not contain any obvious CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, I'll provide a code review and suggest some potential improvements to enhance the code's security.

1. The code retrieves a file name from the command-line arguments without performing any validation. It would be better to validate the file name input to prevent path traversal attacks or unintended file operations. Consider implementing input validation using appropriate security measures.

2. The code uses a `MappedByteBuffer` to read and modify the contents of a file. Ensure that proper security measures are in place to prevent unauthorized access or modification of sensitive files.

3. The code performs string comparison using plain text. When comparing strings, it's recommended to use constant-time comparison algorithms to prevent timing attacks. Consider using a secure string comparison method instead of `startsWith` and `indexOf`.

4. The code uses a hard-coded salt length (`Constants.SALT_LEN`) for generating salts. It would be better to use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate salts of appropriate length. Consider using a secure random number generator, such as `java.security.SecureRandom`, to generate salts.

5. The code retrieves a user's password and attempts to hash it using `SHA256`. It's generally advised to use stronger and more secure hashing algorithms, such as bcrypt or Argon2, for password hashing. Consider using a more secure hashing algorithm for password hashing and storage.

6. The code displays sensitive user information, such as user names, in the console output. In a production environment, it's important to handle sensitive information carefully and avoid displaying it in logs or console outputs. Consider using appropriate logging mechanisms that can handle sensitive information securely.

Overall, the code does not contain any immediate CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities, but these suggestions can help improve the code's security.
