The code provided does not contain any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are a few potential issues that could be addressed:

1. Error handling: The exception handling in the code is not optimal. Instead of simply printing the stack trace, it would be better to log the error or handle it in a more appropriate way.

2. Password handling: Storing passwords in plain text is generally not recommended. Consider using a more secure method for storing and retrieving passwords, such as encryption or hashing.

3. SQL injection: The code does not appear to directly allow SQL injection vulnerabilities. However, it is important to ensure that any user input used in SQL queries is properly validated and sanitized to prevent potential attacks.

4. Access control: The code does not implement any form of access control or authentication for accessing the database. Consider adding appropriate security measures to protect sensitive data.

5. Code organization: The code could benefit from better organization, such as separating database access code from the servlet-related code. This would make it easier to understand and maintain the application.

Overall, while there are no glaring vulnerabilities in the provided code, it is always a good practice to review and enhance security measures in any application.
