There is no obvious CWE or CVE related vulnerability in the provided code. However, there are a few recommendations to improve the code's security and maintainability:

1. Input Validation: The code should validate any input that comes from the user or external sources before using it. This can help prevent various vulnerabilities such as path traversal and command injection.

2. Error Handling: The code does not handle exceptions properly. It should catch and handle exceptions or implement appropriate error logging to ensure that any potential issues are properly addressed.

3. Code Clarity: The code could benefit from better organization and documentation. Adding comments and separating logical sections can improve readability and maintainability.

4. Hard-coded Values: The code contains hard-coded values such as file and directory paths. It is recommended to use configuration files or external properties to allow for easier customization and management.

While there are no specific CWE or CVE numbers associated with the provided code, it is always important to follow secure coding practices and regularly update dependencies to mitigate any potential vulnerabilities.
