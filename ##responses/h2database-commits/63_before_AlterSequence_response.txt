The code you provided does not contain any obvious CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, without further context and knowledge of the system's architecture and usage, it is not possible to fully assess the code for all potential vulnerabilities. It is always recommended to perform a thorough security review and testing of the code in its specific environment to identify and mitigate any security issues.
