Based on the provided code, I don't see any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are some potential issues to consider:

1. SQL Injection: The code executes an SQL script without sanitizing user input. If the "newsfeed.sql" file contains any user-controlled content, it could potentially be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. To mitigate this vulnerability, you should always use parameterized queries or prepared statements to handle user input.

2. Resource Leak: The code opens an InputStream from "newsfeed.sql" but doesn't explicitly close it. This can lead to resource leaks and consume unnecessary system resources. Wrap the InputStream in a try-with-resources statement or explicitly close it in a finally block to ensure proper resource cleanup.

3. Encoding Issues: When converting the HTML content to text in the `convertHtml2Text` method, the code assumes that the encoding is ISO-8859-1. However, this may not always be the case. It's preferable to explicitly specify the encoding or ensure that the correct encoding is used for the input.

Remember that this analysis is based only on the provided code snippet, and there may be other vulnerabilities or issues present in the larger context of the application.
