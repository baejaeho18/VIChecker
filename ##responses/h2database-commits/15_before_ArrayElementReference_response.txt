Based on the provided code, there don't seem to be any obvious CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, without the full context of the code's usage and dependencies, it's difficult to determine if there are any potential vulnerabilities that could be exposed.

A thorough analysis of the entire codebase and its dependencies would be needed to identify and assess any CWE or CVE vulnerabilities accurately. It's always recommended to follow secure coding practices, perform regular security code reviews, and keep dependencies up to date to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
