Based on the code provided, I do not see any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a Java class for a `TruncateValueFunction` that performs value truncation operations.

However, without additional context or information about the code's usage, it is difficult to conduct a thorough analysis for potential vulnerabilities. It is recommended to perform a more comprehensive code review and consider security best practices for the specific use case of this code.
