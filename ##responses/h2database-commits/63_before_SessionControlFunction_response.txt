The provided code does not contain any explicit CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, some potential issues can be identified:

1. Security Misconfiguration (CWE-209): The code does not explicitly check for user authorization before performing session control operations. This could potentially allow unauthorized users to manipulate sessions.

2. Information Disclosure (CWE-200): The code does not handle cases where the target session ID does not exist. As a result, an error message or exception might be displayed, revealing information about the application's internal state.

3. Incomplete Error Handling (CWE-703): The code throws an internal error exception if the function value is not recognized. This could be improved by handling the case gracefully and returning an appropriate error message instead.

It's important to note that the vulnerabilities mentioned above are hypothetical and may or may not be applicable depending on the specific context and usage of this code. A comprehensive security review is recommended to identify additional vulnerabilities and ensure the code's security.
