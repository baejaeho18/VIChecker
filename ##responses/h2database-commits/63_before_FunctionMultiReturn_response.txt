In the provided code, I don't see any CVE-related vulnerabilities. However, there is a CWE-related vulnerability which is CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'). 

This vulnerability can occur in the following lines of code:

```
rs = conn.createStatement().executeQuery("SELECT * FROM P2C_SET('SELECT * FROM TEST')");
```

In this line, the SQL query is constructed using string concatenation, which can lead to SQL injection if the input is not properly validated or sanitized.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use prepared statements and parameterized queries to properly bind the input values. Here's an example of how to do it:

```
PreparedStatement prep = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM P2C_SET(?)");
prep.setString(1, "SELECT * FROM TEST");
ResultSet rs = prep.executeQuery();
```

By using parameterized queries, input values are properly separated from the query structure, preventing any SQL injection attacks.
