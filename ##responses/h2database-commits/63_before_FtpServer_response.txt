There are no specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in this code. However, there are some general security concerns that should be addressed:

1. Insecure default credentials: The code sets default usernames and passwords for read and write access. These should be changed to strong, unique values to prevent unauthorized access.

2. Lack of input validation: The code does not perform sufficient input validation, particularly when processing user-supplied file paths. This could lead to path traversal attacks or other vulnerabilities.

3. Use of deprecated methods: The code uses some deprecated methods, such as FileUtils.size(). These should be replaced with modern alternatives to ensure security and compatibility.

4. Lack of exception handling: The code does not handle exceptions in a robust manner, which could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. Proper exception handling and error reporting should be implemented.

5. Insecure file deletion: The code deletes files using the delete() method from the File class. This method does not guarantee secure deletion, as it only marks the file as deleted in the file system. A more secure method, such as overwriting the file with random data, should be used to ensure permanent deletion.

While these are not specific CWE or CVE vulnerabilities, addressing these concerns will improve the overall security of the code.
