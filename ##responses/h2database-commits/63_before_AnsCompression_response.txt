The above code does not contain any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. It is a utility class for performing ANS (Asymmetric Numeral Systems) compression and decompression. The code is properly structured and there are no obvious security vulnerabilities.

However, it is important to note that analyzing code for vulnerabilities goes beyond just looking at the code itself. Other factors such as the environment in which the code is deployed, input validation, and other security measures also play a role in ensuring the overall security of an application.
