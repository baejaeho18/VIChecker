There doesn't appear to be any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities in the given code. 

The code defines a JSONBoolean class that represents boolean values in JSON format. It has two static fields - FALSE and TRUE - representing the false and true boolean values respectively. The class has a private constructor that takes a boolean value and a public method, getBoolean(), that returns the stored boolean value.

The addTo() method is used to add the boolean value to a JSONTarget object, depending on the stored value. If the value is true, it calls the valueTrue() method of the JSONTarget, otherwise it calls the valueFalse() method.

Overall, the code appears to be secure and does not contain any known vulnerabilities. However, it's always recommended to review and test code thoroughly to ensure its security.
