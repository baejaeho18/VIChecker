Based on the provided code, there doesn't seem to be any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. The code is a simple class `Condition` that extends `Expression` and defines a static method `castToBoolean` along with an overridden `getType` method. The code appears to be focused on defining and manipulating boolean conditions.

However, without more context and the complete codebase, it's difficult to determine if there are any potential vulnerabilities. CWE and CVE specifically refer to known weaknesses or vulnerabilities in code. To identify such vulnerabilities, a thorough analysis of all code dependencies, potential inputs, and data flows would be required.
