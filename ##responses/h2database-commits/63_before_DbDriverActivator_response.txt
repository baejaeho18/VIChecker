There do not appear to be any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code. However, I would like to point out a potential improvement in exception handling. In the `start` method, an exception is caught but no action taken other than returning. It would be more appropriate to log or handle the exception in some way to ensure that any potential issues are properly addressed.
