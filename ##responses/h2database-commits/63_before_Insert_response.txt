Based on the provided code, there are no specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are some potential security issues that you should consider:

1. SQL Injection: The code does not handle parameterized queries, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if user input is directly concatenated into the SQL statement. You should consider using prepared statements or query parameterization to prevent SQL injection attacks.

2. Access Control: It is important to ensure that the session user has the appropriate privileges to insert data into the table. The code should validate the user's permissions before allowing the insert operation.

3. Error Handling: The code catches the `DbException` but does not handle it properly. It checks for a specific error code (ErrorCode.DUPLICATE_KEY_1) but throws the exception for any other error code. This approach could potentially reveal sensitive information or cause unexpected behavior. It is recommended to handle exceptions more gracefully and provide appropriate error messages to the users.

4. Data Validation: The code does not perform sufficient data validation, such as checking for null values or enforcing data constraints. It is important to validate user input and enforce business rules to ensure the integrity and security of the data.

Please note that the identified issues are general security considerations. It is recommended to perform a comprehensive security review of the entire system to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities specific to your application.
