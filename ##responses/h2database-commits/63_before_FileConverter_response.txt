Based on the code provided, there are no clear CWE or CVE vulnerabilities. However, there are a few potential concerns:

1. Insecure file paths: The `inFile` and `outFile` variables are using absolute paths that include the user's home directory (`~/temp/in.txt` and `~/temp/out.txt`). While this may work on some systems, it's generally better to use absolute paths without relying on the user's home directory as it can be manipulated or inaccessible in certain scenarios.

2. Command injection: The `inFile` and `outFile` variables are taken as command-line arguments without any validation or sanitization. If an attacker can control these arguments, they could potentially inject malicious commands or access sensitive files on the system.

To address these concerns, you should consider the following improvements:

- Use platform-independent file paths or validate/sanitize the user-provided paths.
- Perform input validation and sanitization on the command-line arguments to prevent any potential command injection attacks.

Without more context or specific requirements, it's difficult to identify other possible vulnerabilities.
