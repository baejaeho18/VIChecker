After reviewing the provided code, there seems to be a potential vulnerability related to command injection. The `exec` method is used to execute commands provided as arguments, but the arguments are not properly validated or sanitized. This can lead to arbitrary command execution if an attacker can control the arguments passed to the method.

This vulnerability corresponds to CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'). An attacker could potentially manipulate the `args` array to execute unintended commands on the system. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other malicious activities.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should properly validate and sanitize the arguments passed to the `exec` method to prevent command injection attacks. Some possible solutions include:

1. Whitelist the allowed arguments and validate them against the expected values. Only allow specific commands to be executed.
2. Implement proper input sanitization by removing or escaping special characters that could be used for command injection.
3. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of constructing commands dynamically to avoid injection vulnerabilities.

By implementing these mitigation measures, the code can prevent potential command injection vulnerabilities.
