Based on the code provided, there do not appear to be any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are a few best practices that could be improved:

1. Use parameterized queries: Instead of concatenating SQL strings, it is recommended to use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. In this code, the SQL statements should utilize prepared statements with placeholders for dynamic values.

2. Validate user input: The code does not currently validate or sanitize user input, which could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. It is important to validate and sanitize any user input to prevent attacks such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) or SQL injection.

Overall, the code is relatively safe from known vulnerabilities. However, the mentioned best practices should be considered to enhance security.
