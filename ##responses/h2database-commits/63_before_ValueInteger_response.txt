Based on the provided code, I couldn't find any specific CWE or CVE-related vulnerabilities. However, here are a few points to consider:

1. The code does not perform any input validation or sanitization before performing operations like division and modulus. This could potentially lead to arithmetic errors or division by zero if the input values are not properly validated beforehand.

2. The use of a cache for integer values (`STATIC_CACHE` and `DYNAMIC_CACHE`) can potentially lead to memory issues if the cache size is not properly managed. Additionally, the cache could introduce unintended consequences if the values in the cache are modified externally.

It's important to note that these observations are based on the code provided and may not cover all potential vulnerabilities. Conducting a thorough code review and testing with appropriate inputs and scenarios is recommended to identify any possible vulnerabilities accurately.
