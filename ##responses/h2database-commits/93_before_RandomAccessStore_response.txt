I don't see any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code. However, here are a few general recommendations to improve the code:

1. Add appropriate comments to improve code readability and understanding.
2. Consider using more specific access modifiers (e.g., `private` and `protected`) for methods and fields to ensure proper encapsulation.
3. Add exception handling and error checking where necessary, to handle potential errors and exceptions gracefully.
4. Validate input parameters to ensure they comply with the expected format or range of values.
5. Follow consistent naming conventions for variables, methods, and classes to improve code maintainability.
6. Use explicit type declarations instead of relying on type inference in some cases, to improve code readability.
7. Consider using dependency injection instead of explicitly creating new objects within the class, to improve flexibility and testability.

Overall, the code appears to be in good shape, but it would benefit from minor improvements to adhere to best practices and improve code quality.
