In the provided code, there doesn't appear to be any obvious CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, it's worth noting that the code is using raw SQL queries without any input validation or sanitization, which can lead to potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

To mitigate this, it is recommended to use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of concatenating user input directly into the SQL statements. This helps prevent SQL injection attacks by automatically handling escaping or sanitizing user input.
