The code provided appears to be free of any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. 

However, there are a couple of potential issues to note for further analysis:

1. In the `configure` method, when retrieving the value of the "roles" property from `configProperties`, the code checks if it is `null`. This condition will always return `false` since `getStringValue` method returns an empty string if the property does not exist. To fix this, the condition should check if the string is empty (`rolesString.isEmpty()`) instead of `null`.

2. The `configure` method uses a `HashSet` to store the roles after splitting them by commas. While this is generally safe, it's important to ensure that the roles are properly sanitized and validated before adding them to the set to prevent any potential security issues related to untrusted input.

Overall, the code appears to be well-written and secure, but further analysis and testing may be required to ensure its complete security.
