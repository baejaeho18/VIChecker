The code provided does not seem to have any CWE or CVE-related vulnerabilities. It appears to be a class implementation for handling arrays of integers. 

However, it's always recommended to consider potential input validation and error handling for methods like `add`, `get`, `remove`, `ensureCapacity`, `equals`, `hashCode`, `toArray`, and `removeRange` to ensure the code can handle unexpected inputs and prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
