Based on the provided code, there do not appear to be any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities present. However, it is important to note that vulnerabilities can be context-dependent and may arise from other parts of the codebase or the environment in which the code is deployed.

It is always recommended to perform a comprehensive security review of the entire codebase, including any external dependencies or libraries used. Additionally, adherence to secure coding practices, input validation, and proper error handling is crucial for ensuring the overall security of an application.
