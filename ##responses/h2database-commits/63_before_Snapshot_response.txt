Based on the provided code, I don't see any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a simple implementation of a Snapshot class with a root reference and a set of committing transactions. The provided methods (`hashCode()` and `equals()`) seem to be implemented properly and don't introduce any security vulnerabilities.
