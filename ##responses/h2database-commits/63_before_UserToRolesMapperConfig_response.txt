The provided code does not contain any explicit CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) vulnerabilities. However, without seeing the full context and dependencies, there might still be potential vulnerabilities.

The code snippet provided seems to be a simple Java class implementing a user to role mapping configuration. It does not directly handle any user input or perform any critical operations that could lead to CWE or CVE vulnerabilities.

It is always important to analyze the entire application and its dependencies to identify potential security vulnerabilities. Additionally, secure coding practices should be followed, including proper input validation, output encoding, and using secure libraries and frameworks.
