Based on the provided code, there are no obvious CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. However, the code snippet doesn't provide enough context to determine if there are any specific vulnerabilities related to the usage of external resources or potential injections in the `update()` method.

To ensure the code is secure, it is important to verify the implementation of the `SessionLocal`, `Expression`, and `Prepared` classes, as well as any other classes referenced or used within this code snippet. Additionally, it is important to consider how input is handled and sanitized to prevent SQL injection attacks.
