Based on the provided code, there doesn't appear to be any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. The code is a simple implementation of a configuration properties class, which stores key-value pairs in a HashMap and provides methods for retrieving the values.

However, without the implementation of the PropertyConfig class and the Utils class, it is difficult to fully assess the security of the code. It is important to thoroughly review the implementation of those classes to ensure that there are no vulnerabilities present.
