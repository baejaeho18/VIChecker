Based on the provided code, there doesn't appear to be any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are a couple of minor issues that could be improved for better code quality:

1. There is no error handling mechanism in the code. It would be a good practice to handle any potential exceptions that may occur during the execution of SQL statements.

2. The code is directly executing SQL statements without using parameterized queries. This could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized. It would be safer to use parameterized queries instead.

Overall, the code seems to be secure from CWE and CVE vulnerabilities, but there are some areas that could be improved for code quality and security best practices.
