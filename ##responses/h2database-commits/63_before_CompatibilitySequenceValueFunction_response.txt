There are no apparent CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code. However, I did notice a potential SQL injection vulnerability in the `getValue` method. The code uses the variable `sql` directly in the `parseExpression` method without sanitizing or validating it, which could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statements.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to sanitize and validate the input before passing it to the `parseExpression` method, or use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
