This code appears to be a part of a larger codebase for testing database functionality. It does not contain any obvious CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities.

However, there are a few areas where potential vulnerabilities could exist, depending on how this code is used and implemented:

1. Inadequate Validation of User Input:
   - In the `getURL` method, the `name` variable is used directly to construct the URL string without any validation or sanitization. If this value comes from user-supplied input, it could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

2. Use of outdated H2 Database Library:
   - This code imports and uses the H2 database library. It's important to ensure that the version of the library being used does not have any known security vulnerabilities. Checking the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database for the specific version of H2 being used is recommended.

3. Insecure Connection Options:
   - The code sets various connection options, such as `SSL` and `CIPHER`, based on certain conditions. If these options are not handled securely, it could lead to weaknesses or vulnerabilities in the database connection.

To fully evaluate the security of this code, further analysis of the implementation context, usage, and other parts of the codebase would be necessary.
