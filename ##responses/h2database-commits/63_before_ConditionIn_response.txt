Based on the provided code, I didn't find any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. The code mainly consists of expressions and methods for evaluating conditions and optimizing expressions. However, without the full context of the code, it is difficult to determine if there are any specific vulnerabilities related to CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) numbers. It is recommended to perform a thorough security review and testing of the entire application to identify any potential vulnerabilities.
