The provided code does not contain any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. 

However, it is worth mentioning that the code could potentially be improved for better efficiency and readability. 

In the `toString()` method, using a `StringBuilder` would be more efficient than concatenating strings with the `+=` operator. 

Additionally, in the `compareTo()` method, a null-check can be performed using `Objects.equals(o1, o2)` instead of comparing their string representations. This would handle cases where the objects implement their own `equals()` method that may be different from the string representation comparison.
