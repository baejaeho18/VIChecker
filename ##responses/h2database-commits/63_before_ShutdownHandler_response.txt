The provided code is an interface definition and does not contain any explicit vulnerability. CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) and CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) identifiers are specifically associated with known vulnerabilities in software systems. Since the provided code does not include any implementation details, it is not possible to assess if it is vulnerable to any CWE or CVE.

To identify vulnerabilities in software, it is essential to review the actual implementation code and consider potential security issues such as input validation, authentication, encryption, access control, and proper error handling, among other factors.
