Based on the provided code, there do not appear to be any obvious CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. However, it is important to note that the code may be dependent on external libraries or frameworks, which could introduce vulnerabilities. Additionally, the code does interact with a database, so it is crucial to ensure that appropriate security measures are in place such as input validation, parameterized queries, and proper access control.
