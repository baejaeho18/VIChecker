The code provided does not have any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities.

However, there are a few areas where best practices can be improved:

1. User Input Sanitization: The code does not perform any input sanitization/validation for the arguments passed in through the command line. This can potentially lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the arguments are not properly validated.

2. Password Handling: The code currently accepts the password as a command line argument, which can be a security risk. It is recommended to use a more secure method for handling passwords, such as prompting the user for input or using a secure key store.

3. SQL Injection: The code constructs a SQL statement using string concatenation. This can be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks if the input is not properly sanitized. It is recommended to use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

While these are not specific CWE or CVE numbers, they represent common security concerns found in software development.
