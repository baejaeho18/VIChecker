Based on the provided code, I couldn't find any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are a few potential concerns that should be addressed:

1. Incomplete exception handling:
   - In the catch block, the SQLException is caught but not handled. It is best practice to log or handle exceptions appropriately to prevent unexpected behavior.

2. Lack of input validation and sanitization:
   - The code directly concatenates the "i" variable into the SQL statements without any form of input validation or sanitization. This can potentially open up the code to SQL injection attacks if the "i" variable is controlled by an attacker.

3. File handling vulnerabilities:
   - The code performs file operations without proper error handling or checks. For example, when renaming files using the `renameTo()` method, it is recommended to check the return value to ensure the operation was successful.
   - The access to the "data/test.h2.sql" file and its renaming should be carefully handled to prevent any unauthorized access or file manipulation.

4. Lack of secure authentication and authorization:
   - The code does not include authentication or authorization mechanisms when establishing the database connection. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation if not implemented correctly.

To summarize, while there are no CWE or CVE specific vulnerabilities identified, the code should be reviewed and modified to address the concerns mentioned above to improve its security posture.
