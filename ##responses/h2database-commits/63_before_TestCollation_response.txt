Based on the provided code, I don't see any obvious CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. However, I can provide some general recommendations for improving the code:

1. Use PreparedStatement: Instead of using Statement directly, it is recommended to use PreparedStatement to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

2. Protect against resource leaks: Ensure that all resources (such as Connection and Statement) are properly closed in a finally block or by using try-with-resources statement.

3. Input validation and sanitization: Validate and sanitize user input to prevent potential security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection attacks.

4. Error handling: Implement proper error handling mechanisms, including handling and logging of exceptions, to improve code robustness and security.

While the code provided doesn't contain any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities, it is always important to consider the context in which the code is used and ensure best practices are followed to avoid potential vulnerabilities.
