There are no known CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities in the provided code. However, it is important to note that the absence of known vulnerabilities does not guarantee the absence of all potential security issues. It is always recommended to conduct a comprehensive security review and testing to ensure the code is secure. Additionally, keeping software libraries and dependencies up to date can help mitigate known vulnerabilities.
