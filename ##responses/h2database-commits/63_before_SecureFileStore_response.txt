In the provided code, there are no obvious CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, without the implementation details of the `BlockCipher` and `CipherFactory` classes, it is difficult to assess the security of the encryption and decryption operations.

To ensure the code is secure, it is important to carefully review the implementation of the `BlockCipher` and `CipherFactory` classes, as well as any other related classes that handle encryption and decryption. Additionally, it is recommended to perform thorough testing and code review to identify any potential security vulnerabilities or weaknesses.
