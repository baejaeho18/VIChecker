There are no apparent CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the given code. However, there are a few areas that you can improve for better coding practices:

1. The code does not handle exceptions properly. Instead of throwing a RuntimeException, it would be better to catch the exception and handle it appropriately.
2. The code directly reads files using `FileUtils.newInputStream(path)` and `FileUtils.size(path)`, which could potentially lead to path traversal vulnerabilities. It is recommended to validate the input path and use proper input sanitization techniques.
3. The code does not close the input stream (`in.close()`) in all circumstances. It is important to properly handle resource management, especially when working with input/output streams.
4. The code uses a hardcoded hashing algorithm ("SHA-256"). While SHA-256 is considered secure, it might be a good idea to make the hashing algorithm configurable.
5. The code has some unused imports that should be removed to improve code readability.

Overall, the code seems to be relatively secure, but these improvements can enhance its robustness and maintainability.
