Based on the provided code, there don't appear to be any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, it is important to note that this does not guarantee the absence of vulnerabilities. CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) and CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) are databases and systems that classify and track common software vulnerabilities and exposures, respectively.

To further assess the security of this code, we would need to analyze the dependent libraries (imported packages) used in the code. Any known vulnerabilities associated with those libraries could potentially impact the overall security of the code. Additionally, a thorough manual code review and testing would be necessary to identify any specific vulnerabilities within the application logic.

Keep in mind that security is a continuous process, and it is important to stay updated with the latest security patches and best practices to minimize the risk of vulnerabilities.
