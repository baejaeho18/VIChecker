Based on the code provided, I don't see any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a simple implementation of a `Format` class that formats a value into JSON format.

However, without additional context or information about how this code is used and integrated into a larger system, it is difficult to fully assess potential vulnerabilities. It's always important to consider other aspects such as input validation, data sanitization, and secure coding practices when using or implementing code like this.
