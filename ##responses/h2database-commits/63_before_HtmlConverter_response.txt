This code does not contain any specific CWE or CVE vulnerabilities. However, there are a few potential issues to consider:

1. Insecure Deserialization: The code uses two HashMaps (CHAR_MAP and CODE_MAP) to map HTML character codes to corresponding characters and vice versa. However, if these maps are populated with untrusted data, it could lead to insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.

2. Lack of Input Validation: The code does not perform any input validation on the 's' parameter in the 'convertStringToHtml' method and the 'html' parameter in the 'convertHtmlToString' method. This could potentially lead to injection vulnerabilities.

3. Encoding Issues: The code converts special characters in both directions between HTML entities and Java characters. However, it does not take into account any specific encoding or decoding standards, which could result in compatibility or security issues.

4. Hard-coded HTML Character Maps: The code uses hard-coded HTML character maps for the conversion process. If there are any changes or updates to the HTML entity standard, the code may become outdated and incorrect.

To mitigate these potential issues:

- Implement input validation and sanitization to ensure that untrusted data does not cause any security vulnerabilities.
- Use encoding and decoding libraries or methods that adhere to industry-standard practices for HTML entity conversion.
- Allow for configurable or updatable HTML character maps to accommodate future changes or updates to the standard.
