Based on the provided code snippet, I don't see any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are a few potential areas that could lead to vulnerabilities depending on how this code is used:

1. CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
   The code does not include any specific methods or functions, but how these variables are used outside this class could introduce vulnerabilities if proper validation, sanitization, or access control measures are not implemented.

2. CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
   Again, the code does not include any specific functions that could be considered dangerous. However, if the variables in this class are used in SQL queries or other sensitive operations without proper validation, it could lead to SQL injection or other similar vulnerabilities.

3. CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
   This code snippet does not include any hard-coded credentials, but it's important to ensure that if any credentials or sensitive information are used with this code, they should be properly protected and not hard-coded.

It's worth noting that the vulnerability assessment would depend on how this code is used in the larger context of your application. Without more details, it is difficult to make a comprehensive analysis.
