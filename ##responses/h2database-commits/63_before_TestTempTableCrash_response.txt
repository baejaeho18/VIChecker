Based on the provided code, there doesn't appear to be any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities present. However, here are a few general coding practices that may help further improve the code:

1. Avoid Hardcoded Credentials: The code contains the line `conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, "sa", "sa");`. It is generally recommended to avoid hardcoding credentials into the code. Consider using a more secure method of obtaining credentials, such as reading them from a configuration file or using an encryption mechanism.

2. Protect Against SQL Injection: The code uses string concatenation to construct SQL queries, which can be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. It is recommended to use prepared statements or parameterized queries to mitigate this risk.

3. Use a Try-Catch Block for Exception Handling: The code currently throws the `Exception` without handling it. It is considered a good practice to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately, rather than catching the generic `Exception`.

These suggestions are general good coding practices rather than specific vulnerabilities related to CWE or CVE. It's always recommended to review the OWASP Top 10 list and other security resources to ensure the code is secure against common vulnerabilities.
