Based on the provided code, there doesn't seem to be any obvious CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. However, it's important to note that code vulnerabilities can depend on the specific usage context and the code that interacts with this class.

Here are some general comments about the code:

1. Error Handling: The code throws a `DbException` if the table is not found, which provides a better error message compared to just returning a generic error code. However, it would be helpful to log or handle the exception appropriately in the calling code.

2. Authorization: The code checks table-level access rights for the current user using `session.getUser().checkTableRight(table, Right.SCHEMA_OWNER)`. It's crucial to ensure that the authorization and access control mechanisms are properly implemented and validated elsewhere.

3. Input Validation: Without seeing the complete code, it's unclear how the `tableName` value is provided or validated. Ensure that proper input validation is performed to prevent any SQL injection vulnerabilities.

While there don't appear to be any immediate CWE or CVE vulnerabilities in the given code snippet, it's important to perform a thorough security analysis of the entire codebase, including how this class is used and any potential interactions with external data.
