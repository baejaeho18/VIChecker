Based on the provided code, I cannot identify any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, without a thorough understanding of the entire codebase and how this code is used in practice, it is difficult to definitively determine if there are any vulnerabilities present. It is always recommended to perform a comprehensive security review of the entire codebase and its dependencies to identify any potential security vulnerabilities.
