The given code does not seem to have any CWE or CVE related vulnerability. It is a abstract class called `SchemaOwnerCommand` which extends `SchemaCommand`.

However, without additional code context or information about the `SchemaCommand` class and its dependencies, it is not possible to definitively determine if there are any CWE or CVE vulnerabilities. The vulnerability assessment also depends on how these classes are used and the security measures implemented in the overall system.

To perform a more thorough evaluation, it would be helpful to see the implementation of the `SchemaCommand` class and its dependencies, as well as the overall architecture and use of the `SchemaOwnerCommand` class in the wider system.
