There are no apparent CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in this code snippet. However, there are a few general coding practices that could be improved:

1. Lack of input validation: The code assumes that the provided password will always be valid and doesn't perform any input validation. It's a good practice to validate inputs and handle any potential errors appropriately.

2. Unnecessary code repetition: The line `store.load(null, password.toCharArray());` is called twice in the `printKeystore` method. It seems to be a mistake, as the first occurrence can be removed.

3. Excessive blank lines: There are several unnecessary blank lines in the code, which can make it harder to read and maintain. It's recommended to remove them to improve code readability.

4. Lack of exception handling: The code throws `Exception` in the `main` method, but it doesn't handle or specify the specific exceptions that can occur. It's better to explicitly handle or declare the specific exceptions.

Overall, the code appears to be secure, but these suggestions can help improve its quality and maintainability.
