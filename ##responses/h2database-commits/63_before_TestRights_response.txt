The code provided is a Java program that contains several methods to test the rights and access controls in a database system. After reviewing the code, I did not find any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities.

However, as this code seems to be testing a database system, it is important to ensure that the database management system being used is secure and up-to-date, as there might be potential vulnerabilities specific to the database software being tested.

Additionally, it is always recommended to follow secure coding practices and make sure to sanitize user inputs to prevent possible SQL injection vulnerabilities.
