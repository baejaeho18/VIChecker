I don't see any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the given code. However, there are some general coding practices that can be improved:

1. Error Handling: The code does not handle exceptions properly. It throws SQLException without providing any specific information or handling mechanism. It would be better to catch the specific exceptions and handle them accordingly.

2. Input Validation: The `isOption()` method does not perform proper input validation. It assumes that `arg` parameter will always be a valid string. This can potentially lead to unexpected behavior or security issues if the input is not properly validated.

3. Class Naming: The class name "Tool" is very generic and can cause confusion or clashes with other classes in the codebase. It would be better to have a more descriptive and unique name for the class.

Overall, the code appears to be relatively safe from CWE or CVE vulnerabilities. However, it is always recommended to perform a thorough code review and testing to ensure the security and stability of the software.
