Based on the provided code, I have not found any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. However, it is important to note that code alone does not guarantee the absence of vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities can also occur due to insecure configurations, dependencies, or interactions with other components.

It is recommended to conduct a thorough analysis of the entire system, including the usage and context of this code, to identify any potential vulnerabilities.
