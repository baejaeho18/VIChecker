The provided code does not contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. 

The code is an interface definition with three methods:
1. `addRow(Value... values)`: This method takes an array of `Value` objects as input and adds a row of values to the result.
2. `getRowCount()`: This method retrieves the number of rows in the result.
3. `limitsWereApplied()`: This method is used to indicate that limits were applied to the result.

These methods do not appear to have any security vulnerabilities as they are only defining the behavior for adding rows to a result and retrieving row count. However, the implementation of these methods in concrete classes should be reviewed for security vulnerabilities.
