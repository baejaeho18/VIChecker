The code provided does not contain any obvious CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are a few areas that could be improved for security:

1. File Deletion: When deleting a file using `FileUtils.tryDelete()`, the code does not handle any exceptions that may occur. It's recommended to handle and log any exceptions that may be thrown during file deletion to ensure proper error handling.

2. Input Validation: The code does not perform thorough input validation on the `resource` parameter passed in the `addFile()` method. It only checks if the resource is either a String or an AutoCloseable. Depending on how this method is used, it may be necessary to perform additional input validation and sanitization checks to prevent attacks such as directory traversal.

3. Access Control: The code does not enforce any access control mechanisms on the `addFile()` and `deleteFile()` methods. It's important to validate that the caller has the appropriate privileges to add or delete files, especially if this code is part of a larger system handling sensitive or user-controlled data.

4. Error Reporting: The code does not provide detailed error reporting when exceptions occur during file deletion or resource closing. It's recommended to log any exceptions or errors that occur to aid in debugging and troubleshooting.

Overall, while the code does not have any specific CWE or CVE vulnerabilities, it could benefit from additional error handling, input validation, access control, and error reporting to enhance security.
