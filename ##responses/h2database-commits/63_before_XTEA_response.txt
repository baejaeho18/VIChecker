The code you provided does not have any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. However, there are a few potential issues that you may want to consider:

1. Hardcoded Key Schedule: The key schedule in the code is hardcoded and may not provide sufficient entropy. Consider generating a random key or using a secure key generation algorithm instead.

2. Lack of Input Validation: The code does not perform any input validation for the key and input data. It assumes that the input is always correct and aligned. It would be best to add input validation and error handling to handle unexpected or malicious inputs.

3. Use of Deprecated Methods: The code uses the `Bits.readInt` method, which is deprecated in H2 version 1.4.200. Consider using the recommended methods for reading and writing integers.

4. Lack of Secure Coding Practices: The code does not follow some secure coding practices such as using constant-time operations, proper handling of encryption-related exceptions, and secure memory management. These practices can help prevent potential vulnerabilities such as timing attacks, side-channel attacks, and memory leaks.

While there are no specific CWE or CVE numbers associated with these issues in the provided code, addressing them will help improve the security and robustness of the implementation.
