The provided code is a Java class named `AuthConfigException` that extends the `RuntimeException` class. This code does not contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities.

It is important to note that CWE and CVE identifiers are typically associated with specific software vulnerabilities or weaknesses. In the given code, there are no evident vulnerabilities or weaknesses that can be linked to a specific CWE or CVE. However, it is always a good practice to analyze the context in which this code is used, as vulnerabilities can arise from the interactions with other code or configuration.
