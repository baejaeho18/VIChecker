There doesn't appear to be any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code. The code is simply creating a factory method that returns an instance of the DefaultAuthenticator class.

However, it's difficult to determine the presence of security vulnerabilities without understanding the implementation details of the DefaultAuthenticator class and the code that uses this factory method.

To identify potential CWE or CVE vulnerabilities, it's important to review the implementation of the DefaultAuthenticator class and analyze how it handles user authentication and authorization. Additionally, reviewing the code that uses this factory method and how it securely stores and processes user credentials would be necessary.
