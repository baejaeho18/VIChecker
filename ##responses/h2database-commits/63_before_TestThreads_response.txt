Based on the provided code, there don't appear to be any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, the code could be improved in terms of code quality and best practices. Here are some suggestions:

1. The code lacks proper exception handling. It's recommended to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately instead of catch-all "Exception" type.

2. The code could benefit from better comments and documentation to improve readability and understanding.

3. The use of "SELECT * FROM" queries without specifying column names might lead to potential issues in the future. It's generally recommended to specify the exact columns you need rather than using "*", which retrieves all columns.

4. The code creates and uses multiple threads, but there is no synchronization mechanism to handle concurrent access to shared resources. It's important to ensure thread safety in such cases. Consider using synchronization mechanisms such as locks or semaphores to prevent race conditions.

5. The code uses raw SQL statements without using parameterized queries. This makes the code vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. It's recommended to use parameterized queries or prepared statements to mitigate this risk.

6. There is a usage of the deprecated method `testFromMain()`. It's recommended to use the latest non-deprecated methods to ensure compatibility and security.

7. The code uses a random number generator without specifying a seed, which could lead to predictability and security issues. Consider providing a secure random number generator or using a secure seed for randomness.

Overall, while there don't seem to be any specific CWE or CVE vulnerabilities in the code, there are areas of improvement in terms of code quality and security best practices.
