I didn't find any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code. However, there are a few improvements that can be made:

1. Error handling: The code should handle exceptions more gracefully. Currently, it just throws a generic `DbException` with the converted `IOException`. It would be better to provide more specific error messages or handle exceptions in a way that allows for better troubleshooting.

2. Input validation: It's always good practice to validate user input before using it in the code. The `fileNameExpr` obtained from `getValue(session)` should be validated to ensure it is a valid filename and doesn't contain any malicious input.

3. File path manipulation: The method `correctFileName()` replaces backslashes with forward slashes and removes leading slashes. While this may be fine in some cases, it's important to consider the implications of file path manipulation and potential vulnerabilities such as path traversals. It would be better to use safer methods or libraries to handle file paths.

Overall, the code seems to handle backups properly and doesn't seem to have any specific CWE or CVE vulnerabilities. However, it could benefit from the mentioned improvements to enhance security and error handling.
