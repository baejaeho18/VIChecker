The code you provided does not contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. 

The code is implementing a case-insensitive map by extending the HashMap class and overriding some of its methods. The usage of StringUtils.toUpperEnglish() method ensures that the keys are converted to upper case before performing any operations on them, thereby maintaining case insensitivity.

Overall, the code appears to be safe from any known CWE or CVE vulnerabilities.
