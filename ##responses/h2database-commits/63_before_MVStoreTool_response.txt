The given code does not contain any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are few general security concerns that can be considered for this code:

1. Command Injection (CWE-78): The code takes user input from the command line arguments without any validation or sanitization. This can lead to command injection if an attacker provides malicious input.

2. Insecure File Operations: The code performs file operations without explicitly checking the file path or access permissions. This can lead to unauthorized access or modification of files.

3. Potential Information Disclosure: The code prints stack traces and error information directly to the standard output. This can disclose sensitive information that can be used by an attacker during the reconnaissance phase.

To address these concerns, the code should implement appropriate input validation and sanitization techniques, perform proper file path validation or access control checks, and handle error messages and exceptions in a secure manner (e.g., logging or custom error messages without sensitive data).
