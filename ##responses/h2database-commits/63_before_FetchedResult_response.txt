There doesn't appear to be any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code. However, there are a few things that could be improved for best practices:

1. The `createShallowCopy` method is currently returning null. This may not be the desired behavior and could potentially lead to unexpected results. It's recommended to implement the logic for creating a shallow copy of the FetchedResult and return the appropriate object.

Other than that, the code looks fine and doesn't seem to have any security vulnerabilities.
