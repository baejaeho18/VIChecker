I could not find any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code. However, here are some general code review points:

1. The code is missing proper exception handling. Instead of catching the exception and printing the stack trace, the code should handle exceptions appropriately by either logging the error or throwing a custom exception.

2. The code is using a hardcoded username and password for the database connection. Hardcoding sensitive information like credentials is considered insecure. It should be stored securely, such as using environment variables or a configuration file.

3. The code is executing dynamic SQL statements by concatenating input within the code. This can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. It is recommended to use prepared statements with parameterized queries to avoid this issue.

4. The code is creating a subprocess using `ProcessBuilder` and executing commands without proper input validation or sanitization. This can introduce security vulnerabilities, such as command injection. It is crucial to validate and sanitize user input before executing any external commands.

5. There are several commented-out code sections present in the code. These should be removed to improve code readability and maintainability.

Please note that the absence of identified CWE or CVE-related vulnerabilities does not guarantee the absence of other security issues. A comprehensive security review is necessary to ensure the code's security.
