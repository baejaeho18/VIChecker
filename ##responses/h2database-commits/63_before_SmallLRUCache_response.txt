The code provided seems to be a custom implementation of a SmallLRUCache using a LinkedHashMap. As of now, there doesn't appear to be any obvious CWE or CVE-related vulnerabilities in this code.

However, it is important to note that the code does not have any input validation or access control mechanisms. Depending on how this class is used, there could be potential vulnerabilities related to data integrity, confidentiality, or availability. It is recommended to validate and sanitize any inputs before using this cache and ensure that proper access controls are implemented.

Without more context or information about how this class is used, it is difficult to identify potential CWE or CVE vulnerabilities.
