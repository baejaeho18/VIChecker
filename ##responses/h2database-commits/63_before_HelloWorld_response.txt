The code you provided does not appear to contain any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are some general security best practices that could be followed to enhance the security of the code:

1. Secure Input Validation: The code should include input validation to prevent SQL injection attacks. This can be done by using prepared statements or input sanitization techniques.

2. Password Handling: If the code is using credentials to connect to the database, make sure that the passwords are securely stored and not hard-coded within the code. Ideally, passwords should be stored in a secure configuration file or a key management system.

3. Limited Database Permissions: Ensure that the database user used by the application has limited privileges. Only provide the necessary permissions required for the application to function properly.

4. Secure Transport: If the database connection is over the network, make sure to use secure protocols such as SSL/TLS for encrypting the data in transit.

It's worth mentioning that although the provided code snippet doesn't contain any specific vulnerabilities, other parts of the application might introduce security risks. It's important to review the entire application and perform security testing to ensure the absence of vulnerabilities.
