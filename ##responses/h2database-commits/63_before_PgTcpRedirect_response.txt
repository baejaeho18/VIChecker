There are no specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the code provided. However, there are some general security best practices that could be improved:

1. Input validation: The code should validate the input arguments for port numbers to ensure they are within the valid range and do not contain any unexpected characters.

2. Error handling: The code should have proper error handling for network connections and IO operations. For example, catching and handling IOExceptions appropriately instead of just printing the stack trace.

3. Authentication and Authorization: The code does not include any authentication or authorization mechanism. It is important to ensure that the server only accepts connections from authorized clients and that the client provides valid credentials before allowing access.

4. Secure Communication: The code does not implement any encryption or secure communication protocols. It is recommended to use TLS or SSL to protect the data transmitted over the network.

5. Denial of Service: The code could be susceptible to denial of service attacks if it does not enforce any limitations on the number of concurrent connections or properly handle excessive traffic.

Overall, while there are no known CWE or CVE vulnerabilities in the code, it could benefit from additional security measures and best practices implementation.
