There are no obvious CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code. However, there are a few potential issues that could be improved:

1. SQL Injection: The code uses PreparedStatement to mitigate SQL injection vulnerabilities. The placeholders in the SQL queries are parameterized and the values are set using the `setInt` and `setString` methods. This helps prevent SQL injection attacks.

2. Error handling: The code does not have robust error handling. SQLExceptions are thrown but not caught, so if an exception occurs, the program will terminate abruptly. It's recommended to add proper exception handling to catch and handle any potential errors.

3. Resource management: The code opens a database connection but does not close it explicitly. The connection should be closed using the `closeConnection` method after it's no longer needed. Failing to properly close database connections can lead to resource leaks and performance issues.

4. Hard-coded table name and column names: The table name ("TEST") and column names ("ID" and "NAME") are hard-coded in the SQL statements. This makes the code less flexible and harder to maintain. It's better to define these values as constants or retrieve them dynamically from a configuration file.

5. Magic numbers: The code uses a magic number (75) to calculate the number of records to insert in the init method. It's recommended to use named constants or configuration variables to improve code readability and maintainability.

Overall, the code does not contain any major CWE or CVE vulnerabilities, but there are some areas that could be improved for better security and maintainability.
