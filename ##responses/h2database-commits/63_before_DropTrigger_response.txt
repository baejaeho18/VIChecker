The code provided does not contain any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. It is a simple implementation of a class for dropping triggers in a database schema.

However, without the context of the complete codebase and its usage, it is difficult to accurately assess if there are any other vulnerabilities present. It is always recommended to perform a comprehensive security review of the entire codebase to identify any potential vulnerabilities.
