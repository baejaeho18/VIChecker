There are no obvious CWE or CVE-related vulnerabilities in the provided code. However, it is important to note that without the context of the entire application, it is difficult to determine if there are any specific vulnerabilities present.

Here are some general best practices and potential vulnerabilities to consider:

1. Input Validation: Ensure that any user input or external data is properly validated and sanitized before being used in SQL queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. However, there are no SQL queries in the provided code, so this is not a concern.

2. Secure Connection: If the application is connecting to a remote database, ensure that the connection is secured using encryption and proper authentication mechanisms. However, the code provided only connects to a local H2 database, so this is not applicable.

3. Resource Management: Make sure that all database connections, statements, and result sets are properly closed after use to avoid resource leaks. The provided code uses try-with-resources statements to ensure that all resources are closed correctly.

4. Code Injection: Avoid executing user-provided or externally controlled commands without proper validation to prevent command injection attacks. However, there are no instances of command execution in the provided code.

In conclusion, based on the provided code, there are no apparent CWE or CVE-related vulnerabilities. However, it is always recommended to review the code in the context of the entire application and perform a thorough security assessment to identify any potential vulnerabilities.
