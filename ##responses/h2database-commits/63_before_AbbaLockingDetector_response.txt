The code you provided appears to be a deadlock detection implementation. After reviewing the code, I didn't find any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are a few suggestions for improvement:

1. Magic Numbers: The code contains a magic number for the `tickIntervalMs` variable. Consider using a named constant or configuration property instead.
2. Exception Handling: The code catches `InterruptedException` in the `stopCollecting` method, but it doesn't do anything with the exception. It's generally good practice to log or handle exceptions appropriately.
3. Logging: The code currently uses `System.out.println` to output deadlock information. It would be better to use a proper logging framework instead.
4. Thread Safety: The code uses synchronized methods to ensure thread safety when accessing shared data structures. However, it's unclear if this level of synchronization is necessary without understanding the context of how this code is being used.

Overall, the code seems to be well-implemented and doesn't contain any apparent security vulnerabilities. However, it's worth thoroughly testing and reviewing the code in the context of its use to ensure it meets your specific requirements.
