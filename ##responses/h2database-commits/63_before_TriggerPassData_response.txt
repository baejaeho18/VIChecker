There doesn't appear to be any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code. However, there are a few potential improvements that can be made:

1. Avoid storing triggers in a static map: Storing triggers in a static map can potentially lead to memory leaks if triggers are not properly removed from the map. It would be safer to use a different data structure or approach to maintain trigger data.

2. Use prepared statements: The code currently uses statements to execute SQL queries, which can be susceptible to SQL injection attacks. It's recommended to use prepared statements instead to prevent such vulnerabilities.

3. Secure database connection: The code establishes a database connection using the default 'sa' user with an empty password. It's good practice to use strong and secure credentials for database connections to prevent unauthorized access.

These improvements are not related to any specific CWE or CVE numbers, but they help improve the overall security and robustness of the code.
