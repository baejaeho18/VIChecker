The given code does not have any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are a few improvements that can be made for better code quality:

1. Remove unused imports: The code imports some classes that are not used (`TestBase`, `TestDb`). These imports should be removed to improve code readability.

2. Improve exception handling: In the `closingDatabase()` and `opened()` methods, the stack trace of the caught `SQLException` is printed using `e.printStackTrace()`. Instead of printing the stack trace, it would be better to log the exception or handle it in a more meaningful way.

3. Utilize try-with-resources: In the `closingDatabase()` and `opened()` methods, the `Connection` object is being used without utilizing try-with-resources. It is recommended to use try-with-resources to automatically close the connection after use, ensuring proper resource management.

Apart from these suggestions, there are no CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities present in the code.
