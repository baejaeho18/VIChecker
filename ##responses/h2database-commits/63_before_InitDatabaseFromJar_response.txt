In the given code, there doesn't appear to be any specific CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. However, there are some potential security concerns that should be addressed:

1. Injection Vulnerability: The code executes SQL statements based on user-provided data without proper validation or parameterization. This can potentially lead to SQL injection attacks if the input is not properly sanitized.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use prepared statements or parameterized queries to ensure that user input is treated as data and not executable code.

2. Lack of Input Validation: The code assumes that the "script.sql" file exists in the classpath, without checking for its presence. If the file is missing, an exception is thrown but no further action is taken.

To address this issue, proper input validation should be performed to ensure that the required file exists before attempting to read and execute it.

3. Insecure Default Database Configuration: The code uses an in-memory H2 database without any authentication mechanism or secure configuration. This may be acceptable for development or testing purposes, but it can pose a security risk when used in production.

For production environments, it is highly recommended to configure the database with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, as well as secure connection settings to protect sensitive data.

While these issues do not correspond to specific CWE or CVE identifiers, they are common security vulnerabilities that should be addressed to ensure the code's security.
