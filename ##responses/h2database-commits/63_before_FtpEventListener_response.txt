The provided code is an interface definition for an FTP event listener. As it is only an interface and does not contain any implementation details, it is difficult to determine specific CWE or CVE vulnerabilities.

However, it's worth noting that vulnerabilities in the actual implementation of the methods in this interface could potentially lead to security issues. For example, if user input is not properly validated or sanitized within the implementation of these methods, it could result in command injection vulnerabilities (CWE-78). Similarly, if sensitive information is logged or leaked within these methods, it could lead to information disclosure vulnerabilities (CWE-200).

To assess the presence of vulnerabilities, it would be necessary to review the code that implements this interface and analyze how user input is handled, if any external dependencies are used, and how data is managed and validated within the implementation.
