The provided code is an interface definition without any concrete implementation, so it is not possible to identify specific CWE or CVE vulnerabilities in this code alone. 

CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) and CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) are both databases used to catalog and classify vulnerabilities. CWE provides a taxonomy of common software weaknesses, while CVE is a list of publicly known security vulnerabilities. To identify specific vulnerabilities, you would need to analyze the implementation of this interface and consider the context in which it is used.

However, based on the code provided, I can make some general observations:

1. Null Pointer Exception (CWE-476): It is not clear how the `Value[]` array is initialized or populated in the methods `next()`, `addRow()`, `addRows()`, `removeRow()`, and `contains()`. If these methods are not designed to handle null values appropriately, a Null Pointer Exception could occur if a null reference is passed to these methods.

2. Access Control Issues (CWE-284): The code does not provide any access control mechanisms for the methods of this interface. Depending on the context in which this interface is used, it could lead to unauthorized access or modification of data.

To accurately identify and address vulnerabilities in the code, it is important to review the implementation and consider the surrounding code and system architecture.
