The code you provided does not appear to have any obvious CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, it is important to note that determining vulnerabilities in code requires a comprehensive analysis that takes into account all possible code paths, input validation, and potential security risks specific to the application and environment in which the code is deployed. It is always recommended to use secure coding practices, such as input validation and output encoding, to prevent common vulnerabilities like injection attacks.
