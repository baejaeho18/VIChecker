Based on the provided code, there doesn't seem to be any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. This code is simply an interface containing three methods. Without the implementation of these methods, it's impossible to determine if there are any vulnerabilities. 

To identify vulnerabilities, you need to review the implementation of the `CacheWriter` interface and look for coding practices that could potentially lead to security issues. It's also important to perform code analysis and security testing for a comprehensive assessment.
