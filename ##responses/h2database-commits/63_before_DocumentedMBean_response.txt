The code provided does not appear to have any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities.

However, it is important to note that without the code for the `Utils.getResource` method, it is not possible to fully assess the security of the code. The `Utils.getResource` method retrieves a resource by its name, and it is critical to ensure that this method is implemented securely to prevent any potential vulnerabilities.

Additionally, the error handling for the `IOException` in the `getResources` method is empty, which means that any exceptions that occur during the loading of the resources will be ignored. This can lead to potential issues if there are errors in loading the resources and no appropriate action is taken. It is recommended to add appropriate error handling and logging to handle any potential issues that may occur during the loading of the resources.

Overall, the provided code does not exhibit any obvious CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities, but it is important to review and verify the implementation of any external methods (such as `Utils.getResource`) to ensure they are implemented securely and are not introducing any vulnerabilities.
