There don't appear to be any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code. However, here are some general points to consider for code review:

1. Security of input files: The code is loading and storing properties from a file specified by a filename. Ensure that proper input validation and sanitization are performed to prevent directory traversal attacks or arbitrary file access.

2. Error handling: In the `getBooleanProperty()` and `getIntProperty()` methods, catching and printing `Exception` and `IllegalArgumentException` can hide potential issues. Consider logging or handling the exceptions appropriately.

3. Input encoding: The `loadProperties()` method uses `StandardCharsets.ISO_8859_1` for reading the file. Ensure that the file being read is encoded using the specified character set to prevent potential encoding issues or security vulnerabilities.

Overall, the code seems to be well-written and does not exhibit any obvious CWE or CVE vulnerabilities. However, a more comprehensive analysis is required to ensure the absence of any platform-specific or context-specific vulnerabilities.
