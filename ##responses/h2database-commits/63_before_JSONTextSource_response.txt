I have reviewed the provided code and found the following potential vulnerability:

1. CWE-703: Incorrect Use of Exception Throwing Constructs
In the following code block, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown without any specific message or context. It is considered a best practice to provide an informative message with exceptions to aid in debugging and error handling.

```java
throw new IllegalArgumentException();
```

To fix this, you can modify the exception throwing statements to provide a helpful message, such as:

```java
throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid format");
```

Please note that this vulnerability is a best practice violation rather than a security vulnerability. It does not have a CVE associated with it.
