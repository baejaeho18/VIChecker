The code you provided does not contain any obvious CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, code vulnerabilities are highly dependent on the context in which the code is used and how it is integrated with other components or systems. It is always a good practice to perform a thorough code review and testing to identify any potential vulnerabilities specific to your environment.
