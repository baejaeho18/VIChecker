There don't appear to be any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code. However, there are a few general coding practices that could be improved:

1. Exception handling: The code in the `Interval` constructor catches a `DbException` and rethrows it as an `IllegalArgumentException`. It is generally not recommended to catch and rethrow exceptions without providing additional information or performing any other necessary actions. It would be better to either handle the exception appropriately or to remove the try-catch block and let the exception propagate up the call stack.

2. Error messages: The code throws `IllegalArgumentException` in some cases when validation fails. It would be helpful to provide more detailed error messages in these cases to aid in debugging.

3. Input validation: While the code does perform some validation checks on input parameters, it is always a good practice to validate user input thoroughly to prevent potential vulnerabilities such as input validation bypass or injection attacks. Depending on the context in which this code is used, additional input validation checks may be necessary.

Overall, the code appears to be relatively safe and secure. However, code security is not solely determined by a review of the code itself, but also by its interactions with other components and the context in which it is used. A thorough security assessment should consider all these factors.
