Based on the provided code, it appears that there are no obvious CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. However, there are some potential issues that could be considered:

1. Resource Leak:
   - The `Tokenizer` class has a `Reader` field (`reader`) that is not closed or properly managed. This could potentially lead to resource leaks if the `Tokenizer` instance is not closed or garbage collected properly.

2. Input Validation:
   - The code does not perform any input validation on the `Reader` instance provided as a parameter to the `Tokenizer` constructor. Depending on how this `Reader` is used, it could potentially lead to input validation issues such as reading from untrusted or malicious sources.

It is important to note that CWE and CVE vulnerabilities are typically identified by analyzing the entire system and its dependencies. The analysis of a single class or code snippet may not provide a complete assessment of all possible vulnerabilities.
