The code you provided does not contain any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. It is a test class that checks if custom exceptions generated by the `DbException.getJdbcSQLException` method are correctly implemented.

The code uses reflection to iterate over the fields of the `ErrorCode` class and checks if the field modifiers are `PUBLIC`, `STATIC`, and `FINAL`. If they are, the code retrieves the integer value of the field, passes it to the `DbException.getJdbcSQLException` method, and checks the type of the exception returned.

There are no CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in this code. However, it's worth noting that the code relies on the correctness and safety of the `DbException` and `ErrorCode` classes, as well as the correctness of the custom exception implementations. Any vulnerabilities within those classes could potentially affect the behavior of this test.
