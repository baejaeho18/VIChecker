The code provided does not contain any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are some potential areas of improvement:

1. SQL Injection: The code uses prepared statements for parameterized queries, which helps prevent SQL injection. This reduces the risk of CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection').

2. Resource Leakage: The code does not properly close the database connections and statements. It is recommended to use try-with-resources or explicitly close the connections and statements in a finally block to prevent resource leakage and potential CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime.

Overall, the code appears to be free from known CWE or CVE vulnerabilities, but it could be enhanced for better resource management.
