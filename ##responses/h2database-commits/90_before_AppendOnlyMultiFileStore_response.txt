The given code does not contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. However, it is important to note that this code does not include the actual implementation of the methods, just their empty bodies. Without the implementation, it is difficult to determine if any vulnerabilities may be present in the specific functionality being performed by these methods. It is recommended to review the implementation of those methods to ensure that proper input validation, error handling, and security measures are in place to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
