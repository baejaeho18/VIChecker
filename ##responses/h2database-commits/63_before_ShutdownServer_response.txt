Based on the code provided, it appears that there are no CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities present.

However, please note that the code snippet is incomplete. The `org.h2.tools.Server.shutdownTcpServer` method call is missing a parameter, specifically the TCP server URL. Without the complete code, it is difficult to verify if there are any potential vulnerabilities associated with this specific method call.
