The following code does not contain any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are some general coding best practices that could be improved for better security and maintainability:

1. Input validation: The code does not perform any validation or sanitization of input values. It is important to validate and sanitize user input to prevent potential security vulnerabilities like injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).

2. Exception handling: The code uses a generic exception handler (`catch (Exception e)`) which can make it difficult to identify and handle specific exceptions. It is recommended to use specific exception handlers and handle exceptions appropriately based on their types.

3. File handling: The code reads and writes files without proper error handling or resource management. It is important to use try-with-resources or explicitly close file resources to prevent resource leaks and ensure proper cleanup.

4. Code organization and readability: The code could benefit from better organization and readability. For example, using consistent indentation and formatting, adding comments to explain the purpose of methods, variables, and code blocks, and splitting the code into smaller, more focused functions or classes.

While these issues are not specific CWE or CVE vulnerabilities, addressing them can help improve the overall security and maintainability of the code.
