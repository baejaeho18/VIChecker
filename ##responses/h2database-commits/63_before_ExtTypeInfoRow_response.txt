The given code does not have any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities.

However, it's worth mentioning that the code is using a hash-based implementation of `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods. While there are no vulnerabilities associated with this implementation, it's important to ensure that the `TypeInfo` class used within the `fields` LinkedHashMap has implemented these methods correctly to avoid any potential issues related to object equality and hashing in a different context.
