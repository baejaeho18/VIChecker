There do not appear to be any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code snippet. However, there are a few suggestions for improving the code:

1. The exception handling is not sufficient. Instead of just printing the stack trace, it would be better to handle or propagate the exceptions in a more appropriate manner.

2. The `connect()` method should handle InterruptedExceptions more effectively. It can either rethrow the exception or handle it in a way that is suitable for the application.

3. The `receive()`, `send()` and `send(byte[] data)` methods should handle exceptions in a more robust way. Currently, if an exception occurs while performing I/O operations, the socket might not be properly closed, leading to resource leakage. Consider using try-with-resources or a separate try-finally block to ensure proper cleanup of resources.

4. It would be beneficial to validate the input parameters in the `receive()` and `send()` methods. Ensure that the input file name is not null or empty, and check that the skip value is within valid bounds.

5. The `FtpData` class should implement a mechanism to gracefully shut down the thread. As it stands, there is no mechanism to stop or interrupt the thread, which could cause issues if the server needs to be shutdown or restarted.

Overall, the code does not exhibit any CWE or CVE vulnerabilities, but there are opportunities for improvement in terms of exception handling, input validation, and graceful shutdown.
