I have reviewed the code and found several CWE and CVE related vulnerabilities. Here are the identified vulnerabilities:

1. CWE-117: Incorrect Output Encoding
In the `fail()` method, the `file` parameter is used to construct an error message without proper output encoding. Depending on the context in which this message is displayed, it could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

2. CWE-89: SQL Injection
In the `main()` method, the `run()` method is called without validating or sanitizing the input arguments (`args`). This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL commands through the arguments.

3. CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
The line `System.out.println("CHANGED: " + file.getFileName());` in the `checkOrFixFile()` method outputs debugging information to the console. This could disclose sensitive information or provide an avenue for attackers to gather information about the system.

4. CWE-200: Information Exposure
The line `System.out.println("FAIL at " + name + " " + error + " " + file.toAbsolutePath());` in the `fail()` method outputs error messages to the console. This can potentially expose sensitive information to an attacker or unauthorized users.

5. CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
In several places in the code, the result of a method call (`Files.write(file, changed);`) is not checked for errors or exceptions. This can lead to unexpected behavior or data corruption if the write operation fails.

6. CWE-78: OS Command Injection
In the `check()` method, the `Paths.get("src")` argument is passed to `Files.walkFileTree()` without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands by manipulating the file path.

These are the identified vulnerabilities in the code. It is recommended to address them to improve the security and stability of the code.
