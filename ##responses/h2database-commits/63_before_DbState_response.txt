Based on the given code, there are no apparent CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. The code primarily consists of method declarations and variable assignments that do not expose any security vulnerabilities.

However, it's important to note that the code itself is incomplete as many of the methods have not been implemented (e.g., insert, select, delete, update, commit, rollback, etc.). Without the implementation details of these methods, it is not possible to fully assess whether there are any security vulnerabilities within those specific implementations.
