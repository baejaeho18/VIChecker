This code snippet appears to be an interface definition without any implementation. Therefore, it is difficult to identify any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) vulnerabilities within this particular code. 

To identify any vulnerabilities, we would need to examine the implementation code that uses this interface, rather than the interface itself.
