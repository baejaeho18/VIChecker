There doesn't appear to be any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code snippet. However, here are a few security best practices to consider:

1. Input Validation: It is important to validate user input, especially when it is used in a database query or command. This code snippet does not show how the `roleName` parameter is obtained or validated. Ensure that proper input validation and sanitization are performed to prevent SQL injection attacks.

2. Authorization: The code snippet checks if the user executing the command has the necessary administrative privileges (`checkAdmin()`). Make sure that proper authorization checks are enforced throughout the application and that users only have access to the resources they are allowed to access.

3. Error Handling: The code snippet throws a `DbException` if a role or user with the given name already exists. It is important to handle and display errors in a way that does not leak sensitive information to potential attackers.

While the code snippet itself does not contain any apparent vulnerabilities, it is important to review the code in its entirety and consider the context in which it is used to assess any potential security weaknesses.
