The code provided does not appear to have any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are a few security recommendations to consider:
1. SQL Injection: The method `checkPasswordInsecure()` concatenates the input `pwd` directly into the SQL query string, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. To prevent this, it is recommended to use prepared statements and parameterized queries, like in the `checkPasswordSecure()` method, to bind input values securely.
2. Input Validation: It is important to validate and sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries. This can help prevent malicious input that could lead to injection attacks.
3. Connection Handling: The `reconnect()` method does not handle connection failures or exceptions in the current implementation. It is recommended to include proper error handling and connection management to ensure reliable and secure connections to the database.
