There are no explicit CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the given code. However, here are a few potential issues to consider:

1. Code Injection: The `parse` method takes in a `fileName` as input without any validation or sanitization. If an attacker can control the `fileName` input, it could lead to code injection vulnerabilities.

2. Unhandled Exception: In the `parse` method, there is an empty catch block for `NumberFormatException`. This means that if there is an exception while attempting to convert the substring to an integer, it will be silently ignored and may cause unexpected behavior.

3. Missing Input Validation: The `moveTo` method does not validate the input `FilePath path`. It blindly casts it to `FilePathSplit`, which could potentially lead to runtime errors if the cast is not valid.

While these issues may not directly qualify as CWE or CVE vulnerabilities, they can pose security and stability risks if not addressed properly. It is important to conduct a thorough code review and consider the context in which this code is used to identify any further vulnerabilities.
