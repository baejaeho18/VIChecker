The provided code does not appear to have any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. It is a simple class with constants and a static method. 

However, there are a few potential improvements that could be made to enhance code quality and prevent potential issues:

1. The method `valueOf` could benefit from better parameter checking and error handling instead of relying on a generic `DbException.getInternalError()` exception. It would be more helpful to throw a specific exception with a descriptive message.
2. It would be a good practice to add comments or documentation to explain the purpose and usage of the class and its constants.
3. The class could be made final to prevent subclassing, if not intended.
4. Variable names `generatedKeysRequest` could be improved for clarity and readability.
5. Consider adding Javadoc comments to explain the purpose, parameters, and return values of the `valueOf` method.

These improvements are not related to CWE or CVE vulnerabilities but are good coding practices.
