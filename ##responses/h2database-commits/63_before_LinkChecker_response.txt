After reviewing the code, I have found a potential CWE vulnerability in the following section:

```java
try {
    URL url = new URL(link);
    HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
    conn.setConnectTimeout(2000);
    conn.setRequestMethod("GET");
    HttpURLConnection.setFollowRedirects(false);
    conn.connect();
    int code = conn.getResponseCode();
    String msg;
    switch (code) {
        case 200:
            msg = "OK";
            break;
        case 301:
            msg = "Moved Permanently";
            break;
        case 302:
            msg = "Found";
            break;
        case 403:
            msg = "Forbidden";
            break;
        case 404:
            msg = "Not Found";
            break;
        case 500:
            msg = "Internal Server Error";
            break;
        default:
            msg = "?";
    }
    System.out.println(code + " " + msg + " " + link);
    conn.getInputStream().close();
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println("link checker error " + e.toString() + " " + link);
}
```

In this block of code, the `link` variable is used to create a `URL` object without any input validation or sanitization. This can potentially lead to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability if an attacker is able to supply a malicious URL. They can initiate requests to internal systems or cause the server to perform unintended actions.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement proper input validation or sanitization on the `link` variable before using it to create a `URL` object. This can include checking for a valid URL format, whitelisting allowed hosts, or using URL encoding to prevent any possible injection.

This vulnerability might correspond to the CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') or CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), and it may have a corresponding CVE ID if it has been reported and fixed.

Note: Without further context and understanding of the application's use case, it is difficult to determine if this vulnerability poses an actual risk. It is recommended to conduct a comprehensive security assessment of the entire application to identify and mitigate all possible security vulnerabilities.
