I found a few potential CWE-related vulnerabilities in the provided code:

1. In the method `testReadOnlyInZip()`, there is potential for a Command Injection vulnerability. The connection string construction is vulnerable to command injection if the variable `dir` is controlled by an attacker. An attacker could manipulate the value of `dir` to execute arbitrary commands when creating a connection using the `getConnection` method.

2. In the method `testReadOnlyDbCreate()`, there is a potential Insufficient Protection of Alternate Path vulnerability. The method creates a database file using a user-controlled connection string without any checks or restrictions. An attacker could manipulate the `getConnection` method's parameters to create a database file in an unintended location, leading to unauthorized data access or tampering.

3. In the method `testReadOnlyFiles()`, there is a potential Path Traversal vulnerability. The method creates temporary files using `File.createTempFile` without properly validating or sanitizing the file names. An attacker could manipulate the file names to traverse to sensitive directories or overwrite existing files.

4. In the method `setReadOnly()`, there is a potential Path Traversal vulnerability. The method uses `FileLister.getDatabaseFiles` to retrieve a list of database files in a directory based on user-controlled input (`getBaseDir()`). If the `getBaseDir()` method allows user-controlled input, an attacker could manipulate the input to traverse to sensitive directories or access unauthorized files.

Please note that these potential vulnerabilities are based on static code analysis and require a thorough manual analysis to confirm their impact and exploitability. It is recommended to review the code and perform security testing to identify and address these vulnerabilities appropriately.
