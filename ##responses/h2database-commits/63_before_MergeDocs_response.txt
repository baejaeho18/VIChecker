The code you provided does not contain any explicit CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are a few potential issues that you may want to consider:

1. Injection: The `getContent` method reads the content of files using `Paths.get(BASE_DIR, fileName)` without any input validation or sanitization. If an attacker can control the `fileName` parameter, they may be able to perform directory traversal attacks or read sensitive files. It is recommended to validate and sanitize user input before using it as file paths.

2. Unhandled exceptions: The `getContent` method throws a generic `Exception` and does not handle it properly. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if an exception occurs while reading the file. It is best practice to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately to provide better error handling and recovery options.

3. Reliance on file system permissions: The code assumes that the current user executing the code has sufficient permissions to read and write files. If the user running the code does not have the necessary permissions, it may result in exceptions or file access errors.

Overall, while the code does not have any obvious CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities, it is important to review and validate user input, handle exceptions correctly, and consider potential security issues related to file system permissions in order to ensure the code's security.
