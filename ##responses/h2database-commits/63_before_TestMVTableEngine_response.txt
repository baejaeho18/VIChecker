The code provided appears to be Java code that includes various imports and a class named TestMVTableEngine. It is difficult to determine if there are any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities without a more thorough analysis of the code and its dependencies. Additionally, CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) and CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) identifiers are typically assigned to specific vulnerabilities or weaknesses and cannot be determined just from looking at the code itself. To assess the code for vulnerabilities, it would be necessary to review the code in more detail, analyze the dependencies, and run appropriate security analysis tools.
