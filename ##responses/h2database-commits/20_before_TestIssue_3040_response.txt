This code does not contain any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are a few improvements that can be made:

1. SQL Injection vulnerability: The code constructs the SQL statement "CREATE TABLE public." + tableName + " (GENERATED_ID IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY, SIMPLE_VALUE INT)" without properly sanitizing the "tableName" variable. This can potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. To prevent SQL injection, you should use parameterized queries or prepared statements.
  
2. Exception handling: The code prints the stack trace when an SQLException occurs. While it may help during development and debugging, it is generally not recommended to print the stack trace in a production environment as it may reveal sensitive information about the application's internal workings. Instead, you should consider logging the error or providing a more user-friendly error message.

Other than these minor improvements, the code does not have any major security vulnerabilities.
