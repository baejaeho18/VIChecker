The provided code snippet does not contain any direct CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, it is important to note that the code is an interface definition and lacks the implementation details of the methods declared in the interface. Therefore, it is difficult to determine potential vulnerabilities without knowing how the methods are implemented in the implementing classes.

To ensure the security and identify potential CWE or CVE vulnerabilities, it is essential to review the actual implementation of the `TableEngine` interface and evaluate the use and handling of user input, data validation, authentication, access control, error handling, database transactions, and any external dependencies.

Reviewing only the interface definition, no explicit CWE or CVE vulnerabilities can be identified.
