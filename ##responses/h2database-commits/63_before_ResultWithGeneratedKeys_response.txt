Based on the provided code, there doesn't appear to be any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are a few points to consider for best practices and code quality:

1. The class `ResultWithGeneratedKeys` does not provide a public constructor, which means it cannot be instantiated directly outside of the package. This may be an intentional design choice, but it restricts the flexibility of using the class.

2. The method `getGeneratedKeys()` in `ResultWithGeneratedKeys` always returns `null`. This may not be the intended behavior, as the method is not overridden in the subclass `WithKeys`. If the intention is to provide the generated keys, the implementation should be updated accordingly.

Other than these observations, there do not seem to be any specific CWE or CVE vulnerabilities in the code.
