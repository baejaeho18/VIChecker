Based on the provided code, there doesn't appear to be any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. The code simply contains an enumeration of different types of aggregate functions used in the H2 database. This enumeration is used to represent the different aggregate functions that can be used in queries.

Without any implementation details or additional code, it is difficult to identify specific vulnerabilities. However, enumerations themselves do not typically introduce vulnerabilities. It's important to note that the vulnerability assessment should be based on the implementation and usage of the enumeration within the code, rather than solely on the enumeration itself.
