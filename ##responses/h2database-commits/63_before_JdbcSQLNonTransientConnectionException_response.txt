Upon reviewing the provided code, I couldn't find any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, here are a few general observations:

1. The "JdbcSQLNonTransientConnectionException" class extends "SQLNonTransientConnectionException" and implements "JdbcException", which seems to follow standard Java programming practices.

2. The class provides methods to get and set the SQL query that caused the exception, print the stack trace, and retrieve the original and modified error messages. These methods seem to be implemented correctly.

3. The class overrides the "toString()" method to return the "stackTrace" if available, otherwise it delegates to the super implementation.

Overall, the provided code does not appear to contain any significant CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, it's important to ensure that this code is used correctly, integrated securely, and follows best practices when used in a larger system.
