There are no known CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code. However, it is important to note that the code does not handle any authentication or authorization for FTP operations, which could be a potential security risk depending on how the code is used in a larger system. Additionally, the code does not have any input validation or sanitization, which could lead to vulnerabilities such as command injection or directory traversal if user input is used directly in the FTP commands.
