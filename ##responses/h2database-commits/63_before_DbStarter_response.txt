The code provided does not contain any specific CWE or CVE vulnerabilities. However, there are some general best practices that can be improved upon for better security:

1. Error Handling: The catch block in the `contextInitialized` method only prints the exception stack trace. It is recommended to handle exceptions appropriately instead of just printing the stack trace. This can help prevent information disclosure and improve error logging.

2. Password Handling: The code retrieves the database password from a servlet context parameter. Storing passwords in plain text or in easily retrievable form is insecure. It is recommended to use a more secure method, such as encryption or secure storage mechanisms, to protect sensitive data like passwords.

3. SQL Injection: The code does not appear to have direct SQL injection vulnerabilities as it uses prepared statements (`DriverManager.getConnection`). However, it is good practice to validate and sanitize user inputs before using them in database queries to prevent potential SQL injection attacks.

4. Exception Handling: The catch blocks in both `contextInitialized` and `contextDestroyed` methods only print the exception stack traces. It is recommended to handle exceptions appropriately based on the application's requirements and context.

While the code itself does not have any specific CWE or CVE vulnerabilities, it is important to consider other aspects of the application, such as input validation, authentication, access control, and secure communication, to ensure comprehensive security.
