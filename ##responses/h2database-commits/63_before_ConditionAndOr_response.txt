There are no explicit CWE or CVE numbers mentioned in the code provided. However, here are some potential vulnerabilities that could be considered:

1. Injection Vulnerability: The code does not show any direct user input validation or sanitization before using the input in SQL queries. This could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks if the input is not properly validated or sanitized before being used.

2. Access Control Vulnerability: The code does not have any explicit checks for access control or authorization. It's important to ensure that proper access controls are in place to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.

3. Code Injection Vulnerability: The code does not show any evidence of code injection vulnerabilities based on the provided code snippets. However, it's crucial to validate and sanitize any input that is being used to dynamically construct code or query logic.

These are just some general vulnerabilities that could potentially be present in the code. It's important to perform a thorough analysis and review of the entire codebase to identify and mitigate any potential vulnerabilities.
