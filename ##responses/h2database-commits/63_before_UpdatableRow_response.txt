There is a potential security vulnerability in the following code:

```java
String table = rs.getString("TABLE_NAME");
boolean toUpper = !table.equals(tableName) && table.equalsIgnoreCase(tableName);
```

This code retrieves a column from a ResultSet and compares it with the `tableName` variable. However, the `table` variable is not sanitized before the comparison, which could lead to a possible SQL injection vulnerability. An attacker could manipulate the value of the `table` column in the result set to inject malicious SQL code.

To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to sanitize the value of the `table` variable before the comparison. This can be done by using parameterized queries or by using a safe comparison method that doesn't rely on direct string comparison.

The potential CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) for this vulnerability is CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection').

It is also worth noting that without the rest of the code and the specific database schema, it is not possible to identify all possible security vulnerabilities.
