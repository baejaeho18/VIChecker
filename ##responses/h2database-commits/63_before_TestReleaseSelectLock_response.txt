There don't appear to be any CWE or CVE-related vulnerabilities in the provided code. However, I would like to add some general recommendations for code improvement:

1. Close resources in a `finally` block: In the `runConcurrentSelects()` method, make sure to close the ResultSet, PreparedStatement, and Connection resources in a `finally` block to ensure they are properly closed even in case of an exception.
2. Use try-with-resources: Consider using try-with-resources syntax for automatically closing resources such as Statement, ResultSet, and Connection. This will ensure that the resources are closed even if an exception occurs.
3. Follow best practices for multi-threading: While the provided code performs concurrent selects, it doesn't manage shared resources or handle synchronization explicitly. It's important to consider the thread-safety of resources and ensure proper synchronization if needed.
