This code does not have any obvious CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are a few points to consider:

1. SQL Injection: The code uses prepared statements, which helps prevent SQL injection. However, it's still important to validate and sanitize the input parameters before using them in the queries.

2. Error Handling: The code uses try-catch blocks to handle exceptions, but the error messages are not logged or displayed to the user. It's important to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to the user.

3. Resource Management: The code does not explicitly close the database connections and statements. It's important to close these resources properly to avoid potential resource leaks and ensure efficient resource utilization.

4. Testing: The code includes test methods, but it's important to thoroughly test all possible scenarios and edge cases to ensure the robustness and correctness of the code.

Overall, while the code does not have any obvious vulnerabilities, it's important to consider the mentioned points for improving the code's security and reliability.
