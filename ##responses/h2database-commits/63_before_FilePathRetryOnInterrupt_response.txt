The given code does not have any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. 

However, it is important to note that code vulnerabilities can also depend on how the code is being used and integrated within a larger system. Therefore, it is always recommended to perform a comprehensive security analysis to identify any potential vulnerabilities specific to the context in which the code is being used.
