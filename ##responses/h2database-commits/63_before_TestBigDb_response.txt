The code provided does not contain any specific CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. However, it's worth mentioning a few potential issues or best practice recommendations:

1. Code Injection Vulnerability: The code executes dynamic SQL statements with user input without any input validation or parameterization. This can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if user input is not properly sanitized. To prevent this, it is recommended to use parameterized queries or prepared statements.

2. Resource Leakage: The code establishes a database connection but does not close it properly in case of exceptions or when the operation is completed. It is important to close resources like database connections, statements, and result sets in a finally block or by using the try-with-resources construct.

3. Out of Memory Error: The code inserts a large number of records into the "TEST" table without implementing any mechanism to handle memory limitations. This can lead to an OutOfMemoryError if the system does not have enough memory to handle the operation. It is recommended to implement pagination or batch processing when dealing with large data sets to avoid excessive memory usage.

These recommendations are based on general best practices and may not be directly related to specific CWE or CVE entries. It is always important to consider the specific context and requirements of the application when identifying and addressing vulnerabilities.
