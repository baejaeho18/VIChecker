The provided code is a class named "VirtualTableIndex" that extends the "Index" class. Based on the code provided, there don't appear to be any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. 

The code is simply defining abstract methods inherited from the "Index" class without implementing them. These methods are intentionally throwing an exception to indicate that they are not supported for virtual tables. This is by design and does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.

In general, it is always important to review the implementation of the abstract methods in the concrete classes that extend this abstract class to ensure that they are properly implemented and do not introduce any vulnerabilities. However, without the complete implementation of the class, it is not possible to identify any specific vulnerabilities.
