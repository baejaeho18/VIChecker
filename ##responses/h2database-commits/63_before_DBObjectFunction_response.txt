1. Input validation: Ensure that the input values (objectType, schema name, object name) are properly validated to prevent any potential injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
2. Authentication and authorization: Validate that the session user has the necessary privileges to execute the function before performing any sensitive operations.
3. Error handling: Handle any potential exceptions or error conditions gracefully and securely to prevent information disclosure or other vulnerabilities.
4. Code review and testing: Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing to identify any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the implementation.

It's important to note that this assessment is based solely on the code provided and a more comprehensive review is recommended to ensure the overall security of the entire application.
