Based on the provided code, it is difficult to determine specific CWE or CVE identifiers without a more comprehensive understanding of the system and its dependencies. However, there are some potential vulnerabilities and best practices that can be mentioned:

1. Input Validation: The code does not have input validation or sanitization for the 'line' parameter passed to the 'Parser' constructor. This can potentially lead to input-related vulnerabilities such as injection attacks. It is important to sanitize and validate user input to prevent malicious input from causing harm.

2. Exception Handling: The code uses a generic 'RuntimeException' for error handling and reporting. It is recommended to use more specific exceptions and handle them appropriately to provide clearer error messages and to prevent information leakage.

3. Class/Object Reflection: The code uses reflection and dynamic object creation ('new') based on user input. This can introduce security risks if not properly validated or if user input is used directly in reflective operations without appropriate checks and safeguards. It is important to validate and sanitize user inputs and restrict the use of reflection to only necessary scenarios.

It is advised to conduct a more comprehensive security review and testing of the code to identify and address any vulnerabilities specific to the system and its dependencies.
