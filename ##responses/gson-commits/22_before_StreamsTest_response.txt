The provided code does not contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. 

However, it is worth noting that the code is missing exception handling for the `IOException` that can be thrown by the `flush()` and `close()` methods of the `Writer` class. It is generally good practice to handle IOExceptions appropriately, either by catching and handling them, or by declaring them to be thrown by the method.
