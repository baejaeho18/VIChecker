The provided code does not appear to have any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. It mainly consists of test cases for the `ConstructorConstructor` class.

However, there are a few potential improvements that could be made to the code:

1. The code could benefit from more meaningful variable names. For example, instead of using the variable name `constructor`, more descriptive names such as `abstractClassConstructor` or `interfaceConstructor` could be used.

2. The code could also make use of more appropriate assertions. Instead of using `assertEquals` to compare the exception message, it would be better to use `assertTrue` and check if the exception message contains the expected string. This allows for more flexibility in the exception message structure.

Other than these suggestions, the code does not exhibit any major security vulnerabilities.
