In the given code, there are no specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are some security-related concerns that can be addressed.

1. CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource: 
   In the `testRestrictiveSecurityManager` method, the code sets up a security manager and overrides the `checkPermission` method. It selectively allows or denies certain permissions. However, it is important to ensure that the permissions being checked and the associated exceptions are appropriate and adequately secure the critical resources. A thorough review of the permission checks and exceptions thrown should be conducted to avoid incorrect permission assignment.

2. CWE-732: Insecure Class Load Time Initialization:
   The `loadClassWithDifferentClassLoader` method loads a class with a different class loader. This can introduce security risks if the loaded class is not properly validated or sanitized. It is important to ensure that the loaded class is from a trusted source and that any potential security vulnerabilities or risks associated with the loaded class are mitigated.

3. CWE-395: Use of Deprecated Functions:
   In the `testRestrictiveSecurityManager` method, the `@SuppressWarnings("removal")` annotation is used to suppress the deprecation warning for the `RuntimePermission` constructor. While it may be necessary to use deprecated functions in some cases, it is important to carefully evaluate the risks and implications and consider using alternative solutions if available.

It is worth noting that the identification of vulnerabilities and their associated CWE or CVE numbers is a complex process that requires a thorough analysis of the code in its specific context and dependencies. The provided assessment is based on a superficial review and is not exhaustive. It is recommended to conduct a comprehensive security review and static code analysis to identify any potential vulnerabilities accurately.
