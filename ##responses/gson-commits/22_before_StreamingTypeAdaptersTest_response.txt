The code provided does not contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities.

However, it is worth noting that the code uses the `replace()` method to replace characters in JSON strings. This could potentially introduce vulnerabilities if the replacement characters are not properly escaped or validated. It is recommended to use a proper JSON library or framework for handling JSON data to minimize the risk of injection or other vulnerabilities.
