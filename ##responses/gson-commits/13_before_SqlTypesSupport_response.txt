There is no specific CWE or CVE related vulnerability present in the given code. However, it is important to note that this code depends on the availability of the "java.sql.Date" class, which may not be present in all environments. Therefore, it is advisable to handle the ClassNotFoundException and implement appropriate error handling or fallback behavior if the class is not found.

Additionally, it is a good practice to provide proper access modifiers to the variables and methods in the class to control their visibility and prevent unintended access from outside the package. In the given code, all variables and methods are declared as public, which may not be necessary.

Overall, no specific CWE or CVE is identified, but it is recommended to handle exceptions and review access modifiers for better code quality.
