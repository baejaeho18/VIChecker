Based on the provided code, there are no CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. 

The code is a simple Java class with two fields, "i" and "i2". The "i" field is annotated with the "@Expose" annotation from the Google Gson library, which is used for JSON serialization/deserialization. This annotation is not considered a vulnerability in itself.

To verify if there are any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities, it is necessary to review the entire context, including the usage of this class and any external dependencies, as vulnerabilities can arise from various factors such as input validation, insecure coding practices, or the use of vulnerable libraries.
