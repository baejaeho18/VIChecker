Based on the code provided, I did not identify any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a basic implementation of a JsonArray class with methods to add, remove, and retrieve elements from the array. However, without the context of how this code is being used and the specific requirements, it is difficult to determine if there are any potential vulnerabilities.
