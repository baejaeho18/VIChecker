The code provided does not contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities.

However, it's worth noting that the code could potentially have CWE-676 (Use of Potentially Dangerous Function) if there is any code that handles user input or untrusted data. Without any context on how the `Gson` library is used in the rest of the application, it's difficult to determine if this vulnerability exists.

To mitigate CWE-676, it is recommended to properly validate and sanitize user input before using it with the Gson library.
