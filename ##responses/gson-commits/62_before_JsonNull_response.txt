This code does not have any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there is one potential issue that can be pointed out:

1. Deprecated Constructor: The `public JsonNull()` constructor is marked as `@Deprecated`, which means it is discouraged to use. However, since this class is marked as `final` and cannot be extended, this constructor is not accessible outside the class. Therefore, it may be unnecessary to mark it as deprecated. If it is intended to discourage the use of this constructor within the class itself, it would be helpful to add a comment explaining why it is deprecated.

Other than that, there are no specific CWE or CVE vulnerabilities present in this code.
