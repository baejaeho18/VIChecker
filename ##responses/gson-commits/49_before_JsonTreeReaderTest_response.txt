The provided code does not contain any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are a few improvements and best practices that can be implemented:

1. Remove the unused import statements to improve code readability and reduce clutter.

2. Remove the "@SuppressWarnings("resource")" annotation as it is unnecessary in this code.

3. The test method names could be more descriptive and follow the naming convention for test methods.

4. Add specific assertions to test cases instead of just asserting the equality of expected and actual values. This will provide more information in case of test failures.

These suggestions are not related to CWE or CVE vulnerabilities but rather code improvements and best practices.
