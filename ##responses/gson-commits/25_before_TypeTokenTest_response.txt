The code provided does not contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities.

CWE and CVE are identifiers used to categorize and track software vulnerabilities and weaknesses. To identify CWE or CVE vulnerabilities, you would typically look for specific coding patterns or known vulnerabilities in the code. In this case, I did not find any such vulnerabilities.

However, it's important to note that vulnerabilities can also exist in the dependencies or libraries used by this code. Without knowing the specific versions of the dependencies and conducting a thorough analysis, it's not possible to identify CWE or CVE vulnerabilities related to the dependencies.
