There are two issues with the provided code:

1. CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting')
The issue is present in the following line:
```
+ "  # this is yet another comment\n"
```
In this line, a comment is inserted into a JSON string. However, the comment contains a newline character, which could potentially be used for HTTP response splitting attacks. To fix this vulnerability, the comment should be removed or properly escaped.

2. CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
The issue is present in the following line:
```
new Gson().fromJson(json, new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}.getType());
```
The code is using the Gson library to deserialize JSON data into a list of strings. However, deserialization of untrusted data can lead to various security vulnerabilities, such as remote code execution or denial of service attacks. It is important to validate or sanitize the input JSON data before deserializing it.

It is recommended to handle comments in a way that adheres to the JSON specification and to implement proper input validation and sanitization when deserializing untrusted JSON data.
