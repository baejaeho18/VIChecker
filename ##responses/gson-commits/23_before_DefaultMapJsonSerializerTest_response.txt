The given code does not have any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities.

However, there are a few suggestions to improve the code:

1. Avoid using wildcard imports:
   Instead of using `import static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue`, you should import only the specific classes and methods you need. For example, `import static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue;` can be replaced with `import static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue;`.

2. Remove redundant variable assignment:
   In the test methods `testEmptyMapNoTypeSerialization()` and `testNonEmptyMapSerialization()`, you have unnecessary variable assignment for `Gson`. You can remove the line `Gson gson = new Gson();`.

3. Add more comprehensive test cases:
   The provided tests only cover basic scenarios of empty and non-empty maps. It would be beneficial to include more test cases to ensure the code handles different map sizes, different value types, and edge cases.

Overall, the code appears to be free from CWE or CVE vulnerabilities, but there are some minor improvements that can be made.
