I couldn't find any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities in the provided code. The code appears to be implementing tests for formatting styles in the Google Gson library.

The code mainly focuses on testing different newline and indent combinations for pretty printing JSON using the Gson library. It also includes tests to check the validity of the formatting styles.

Overall, the code looks fine and does not appear to have any CWE or CVE vulnerabilities.
