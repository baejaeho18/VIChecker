There are no CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities present in the provided code. The code appears to be implementing the `JsonPrimitive` class from the Gson library, which is responsible for representing JSON primitive values such as numbers, booleans, and strings. The code follows the expected conventions for handling and parsing these values.

It's worth noting that the code uses the `Objects.requireNonNull` method to ensure that the provided values are not null when constructing the `JsonPrimitive` object. This helps prevent null pointer exceptions.

Overall, the code seems safe and well-implemented, without any glaring vulnerabilities.
