The provided code snippet is incomplete and contains a commented line. Therefore, it is difficult to identify any specific CWE or CVE vulnerabilities without the complete code. However, there is a missing string value in the createUrl() method's return statement.

If you provide the complete code, I can review it further for any potential vulnerabilities.
