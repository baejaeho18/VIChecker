The code you provided does not contain any obvious CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities.

The usage of `@Since` and `@Until` annotations from the `com.google.gson.annotations` package suggests the intention to indicate the version compatibility of specific fields. These annotations are typically used when serializing and deserializing Java objects to and from JSON using the Gson library.

However, it is worth noting that vulnerabilities related to data serialization and deserialization, such as insecure deserialization, can be introduced if the JSON payloads handled by this class come from untrusted sources. To ensure the security and prevent potential vulnerabilities, it is important to properly validate and sanitize the input data.

In summary, based on the provided code snippet, there are no apparent CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, it is crucial to consider security practices when handling serialized data to avoid potential issues.
