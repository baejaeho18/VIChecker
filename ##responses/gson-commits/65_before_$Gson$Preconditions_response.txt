The provided code does not contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities.

The code is a simple utility class named `$Gson$Preconditions`. It provides two methods:

1. `checkNotNull(T obj)`: This method checks if the provided object `obj` is null or not. If it is null, it throws a `NullPointerException`. This is a common practice to enforce non-null arguments in methods.

2. `checkArgument(boolean condition)`: This method checks if the provided boolean `condition` is false. If it is false, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`. This can be used to validate certain conditions before executing code.

Both methods are designed to handle common scenarios where input validation is needed. The code is simple and does not have any potential vulnerabilities.
