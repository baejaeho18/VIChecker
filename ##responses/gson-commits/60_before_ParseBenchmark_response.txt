Based on the provided code, I did not find any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerability. However, it is important to note that security vulnerabilities are not solely dependent on code, but also on the context in which the code is used and the specific libraries and dependencies it relies on. It is always recommended to keep all dependencies up to date and follow secure coding practices to minimize the risk of vulnerabilities.
