The code provided appears to be a Java class for working with JSON data using the Gson library. After reviewing the code, I did not find any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities.

However, it is important to note that this code is just a class definition and does not include any implementation details or code for parsing or serializing JSON data. The security of the final application using this class may depend on the implementation and usage of this class within that application.
