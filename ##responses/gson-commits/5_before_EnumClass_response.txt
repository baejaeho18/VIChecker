The provided code is an enumeration class in Java and does not contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. It is a simple and standard implementation of an enum.

Enums are a type-safe way to define a set of named constants. The code defines an enum called "EnumClass" with two constants, "FIRST" and "SECOND". Enums are considered safe in terms of security, as they only define a fixed set of values without any methods or data.

Therefore, there are no CWE or CVE vulnerabilities to be highlighted in this code snippet.
