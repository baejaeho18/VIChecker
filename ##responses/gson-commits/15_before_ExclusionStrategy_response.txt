The provided code does not contain any specific CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities.

However, it is important to note that the code snippet alone does not provide enough context to determine if there are any security vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities can arise from the implementation or usage of the provided interface and its methods, rather than the interface itself.

To ensure security, it is crucial to consider potential issues related to data validation, input/output handling, authentication, and authorization, among others. It is recommended to perform a comprehensive security assessment and consider secure coding practices to minimize the risk of vulnerabilities.
