This code does not contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities.

However, there are a few suggestions to consider:

1. The use of default values in the constructor could lead to unexpected behavior. It might be better to remove the constructor with default values and require explicit initialization of the object.

2. When generating the JSON representation in the `getExpectedJson()` method, it is recommended to use a proper JSON library like Gson to serialize the object, rather than manually constructing the JSON string. This ensures proper handling of special characters, escaping, and object serialization.

3. It is always a good practice to validate or sanitize user inputs before using them, especially when dealing with strings. Consider adding validation or sanitization checks for the `stringValue` field.

4. The `hashCode()` method implementation can be improved by using the `Objects.hash()` method introduced in Java 7, which simplifies the calculation of hash codes for multiple fields.

Overall, the code provided appears to be well-written and does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good idea to review and analyze the code in the context of its usage and surrounding application to ensure its security.
