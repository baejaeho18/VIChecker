There are no obvious CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code. However, it's important to note that security vulnerabilities can exist in the libraries or dependencies used by this code, rather than the code itself. It's always recommended to keep all dependencies up to date and regularly check for any known vulnerabilities in those dependencies by referring to their vulnerability tracking systems (such as CWE or CVE databases) and taking appropriate action to address any identified vulnerabilities.
