The provided code does not have any specific CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities. 

However, there are a few potential issues and recommendations to improve the code:

1. Lack of input validation: The code assumes that the input `javaVersion` provided to `getMajorJavaVersion(String javaVersion)` is a valid version string. It would be better to add input validation to ensure that the input is valid.

2. Reliance on System.getProperty("java.version"): The code relies on `System.getProperty("java.version")` to determine the Java version. This may not always be reliable, especially if the system property is modified or unavailable. Consider using a more robust method to determine the Java version, such as querying the appropriate system APIs.

3. Use try-with-resources for resource management: The code does not perform any resource management, but if any resources were to be used in this class, it would be recommended to use try-with-resources to ensure proper resource closure.

4. Unused constructor: The private constructor `private JavaVersion() { }` is not used anywhere in the code. It can be safely removed unless there is a specific reason for its existence.

While these recommendations do not directly address CWE or CVE vulnerabilities, they can help improve the code's reliability and maintainability.
