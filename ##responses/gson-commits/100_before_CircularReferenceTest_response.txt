The given code does not have any obvious CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, there are a few points worth mentioning:

1. The code uses the `junit.framework.TestCase` class, which is part of JUnit 3. JUnit 3 is considered outdated, and it is recommended to migrate to JUnit 4 or newer versions.

2. The code does not handle exceptions properly. In some test methods, a `StackOverflowError` is expected but not explicitly caught. It would be better to catch the expected exception using the `expected` attribute of the `@Test` annotation (if using JUnit 4 or newer) or using a try-catch block to handle the exception and perform appropriate assertions.

Apart from these points, there are no apparent CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the code.
