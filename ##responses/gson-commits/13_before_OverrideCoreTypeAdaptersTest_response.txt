There are no CWE or CVE vulnerabilities in the given code. The code appears to be using the Gson library to register custom type adapters for boolean values and strings. TypeAdapter classes are used to serialize and deserialize objects of specific types to JSON.

The code defines two TypeAdapter objects: `booleanAsIntAdapter` and `swapCaseStringAdapter`. These adapters override the default behavior of Gson for serializing and deserializing boolean values and strings, respectively.

The code includes three test methods that demonstrate the usage of the custom type adapters with different scenarios.

Overall, the code seems to be well-written and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
