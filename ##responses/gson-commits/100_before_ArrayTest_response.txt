There is one CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) vulnerability in the code:

CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
- In the method "testArrayOfPrimitivesAsObjectsDeserialization", the code uses the 'json' variable to store a JSON string that is later passed to the "new BigDecimal" constructor. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service by passing a malicious input as 'json'. To mitigate this vulnerability, the input should be properly sanitized and validated before being used.

There are no CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities in the code.
