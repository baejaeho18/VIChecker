There are several issues in the provided code that may lead to CWE or CVE vulnerabilities:

1. CWE-346: Insecure Randomness: The code is using `System.currentTimeMillis()` to measure the time taken for performance testing. This can lead to insecure randomness if used for cryptographic purposes.

2. CWE-470: Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code: The code uses `gson.fromJson(json, ExceptionHolder.class)` to deserialize JSON data into an `ExceptionHolder` object. If the `json` string is controlled by an attacker, they may be able to inject malicious code or select arbitrary classes.

3. CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data: The code deserializes the `json` string using `gson.fromJson(json, collectionType)`. If the JSON data is untrusted or attacker-controlled, it may lead to deserialization vulnerabilities, such as remote code execution or arbitrary code execution.

4. CWE-561: Dead Code: There are several test methods in the code that have been disabled by using the `disabled_test` prefix. These methods are not executed and are effectively dead code, which can be misleading and may introduce future maintenance issues.

5. CWE-597: Use of Wrong Operator in String Concatenation: In the `disabled_testLargeCollectionDeserialization` method, the concatenation of JSON objects is done using string concatenation with `+` operator instead of JSON-specific formatting. This can lead to malformed JSON strings and parsing errors.

It's important to note that any CWE or CVE identification numbers may change over time as new vulnerabilities are discovered and assigned. It's recommended to regularly review vulnerability databases and keep the code up to date with the latest security patches.
