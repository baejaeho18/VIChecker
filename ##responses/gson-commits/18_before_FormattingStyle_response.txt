The provided code does not contain any CWE or CVE vulnerabilities. It is a simple class that represents a formatting style. 

However, there are a few potential improvements that could be made to the code:

1. The `FormatStyle` class could benefit from encapsulation. Currently, the newline and indent fields are public, meaning they can be directly accessed and modified from outside the class. It would be better to make these fields private and provide getter methods (`getNewline()` and `getIndent()`) for accessing their values.

2. The `FormatStyle` class uses the `Objects.requireNonNull` method to check for null values of `newline` and `indent` parameters in the constructor. This is a good practice. However, it would be better to provide more descriptive error messages when null values are passed. For example, instead of "newline == null" and "indent == null", you could use "newline parameter cannot be null" and "indent parameter cannot be null".

Overall, the code is relatively safe and there are no major security vulnerabilities related to CWE or CVE.
