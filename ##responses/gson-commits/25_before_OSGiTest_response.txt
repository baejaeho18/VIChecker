Based on the given code, there does not appear to be any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities present. The code mainly consists of unit tests that check for certain dependencies and conditions in the code.

However, to accurately determine the existence of CWE or CVE vulnerabilities in the code, it would be necessary to analyze the dependencies and imports used in the project and also assess the environment in which the code runs. Without such information, it is not possible to definitively identify any specific CWE or CVE numbers or vulnerabilities.
