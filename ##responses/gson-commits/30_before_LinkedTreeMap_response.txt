There don't seem to be any specific CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code. However, there are a few general security considerations to note:

1. Input Validation: The code should include proper input validation to prevent any potential injection attacks or other security vulnerabilities when handling user-provided input.

2. Secure Serialization: The implementation of serialization and deserialization should follow secure practices to prevent any security risks, such as code execution or remote code execution attacks. The current implementation does not implement the readObject method and throws an InvalidObjectException, which is a good practice for security reasons.

Overall, the code appears to be mostly secure, but it is always recommended to conduct a thorough code review and security testing to identify any potential vulnerabilities specific to your application or system.
