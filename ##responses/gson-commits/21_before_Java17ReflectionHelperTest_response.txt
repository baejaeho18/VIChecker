There are no obvious CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities in the provided code. However, it is important to note that this code relies on external dependencies (`com.google.common.truth.Truth`) and assumes that the `jdk.net.UnixDomainPrincipal` class exists in the system.

To ensure the security of the code, it is important to make sure that the external dependencies are up to date and do not have any known vulnerabilities. Additionally, make sure that the `jdk.net.UnixDomainPrincipal` class is available in the system and does not have any known vulnerabilities.

Without knowing the specific versions of the external dependencies and the underlying system, it is not possible to determine specific CWE or CVE numbers. It is always recommended to keep dependencies up to date and follow best practices for secure coding.
