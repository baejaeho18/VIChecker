The code you provided does not appear to have any CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. It is a simple Java class that uses Gson library to serialize and deserialize a custom class.

However, there are some potential improvements you can make to ensure best practices and improve code quality:

1. Null Pointer Exception: There is no null check in the constructor for the `i` parameter. It is always good practice to validate inputs for nullity.

2. Input Validation: The current code assumes that the input JSON will have the "custom" field with an integer value. There is no validation or handling for cases where the input JSON is malformed or missing the required field. It is recommended to add proper validation to handle such cases.

3. Documentation: It would be beneficial to provide some comments or documentation explaining the purpose and usage of the `ClassWithAdapter` class and the `Adapter` class.

By addressing these suggestions, you can enhance the reliability and maintainability of your code.
