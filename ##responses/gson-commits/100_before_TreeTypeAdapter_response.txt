The code you provided does not contain any obvious CWE or CVE related vulnerabilities. However, it is important to conduct a thorough code review and static analysis to identify any potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, CWE and CVE numbers are typically assigned to specific vulnerabilities based on their nature, so without a specific vulnerability in mind, it is not possible to provide an accurate CWE or CVE number for the code.
