The code provided does not contain any CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) or CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related vulnerabilities.

However, it's worth noting that this code determines the major version of Java being used by parsing the "java.version" system property. If this code is used in an application where the "java.version" system property can be manipulated or spoofed by an attacker, it could lead to a version misrepresentation vulnerability.
